there you are let's find out how stocks are doing um
S&P is up a little bit tesla is up a little bit
yeah little optimism this morning let's make sure I got all my comments
working and then we got a show for you
all right
good morning everyone and welcome to the Coffee with Scott Adams show and if
you'd like to take this experience up to levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a cup or a mug
or a glass of tanker chestine a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparallel pleasure the dopamine end of
the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
ah delicious so so good well what's happening well
Honda the automaker um has entered the reusable space rocket
business and they actually uh demonstrated a rocket that went up and
uh came back down and landed with no chopsticks whatsoever
which makes me wonder is this better than the uh SpaceX
cuz SpaceX needed big chopsticks but the Honda rocket just went up and
came back down and landed the way it was could it be that there's yet another
advancement in space could be so Honda
Honda's pretty serious there meanwhile um as you were expecting uh Trump has
extended the Tik Tok ban for another 90 days meaning the
meaning they're delaying the ban for 90 days until they can find a buyer which I
think will not happen i've been predicting the the whole time
that China will never agree china is not going to agree to sell Tik
Tok so either Tik Tok will go away which
Trump does not want or he'll just keep extending it the whole time he's in
office that's possible um apparently sometime today there will be a Fed
interest rate decision has that already happened does anybody know when that
happens but that'll move the market a little bit and of course the markets are
kind of uh sensitive to what's happening in Iran because that might affect the
straight of horses and the oil production and all that stuff
but so far the world is not that jittery about oil which is weird you would think
they would be a little bit more uncertain but uh there's a little bit of
uncertainty in the oil prices but not as much as you think
um so yesterday I mentioned that I saw a uh a drug test from Elon Musk but I
wasn't sure it was really his it really was his so uh he has confirmed that was
his drug test it was all negative and he's challenged he's challenged his
critics at the New York Times to take a drug test of their own
which I think is hilarious because what are the odds that the uh editors and
reporters at the New York Times could all pass a drug test
i don't know kind of low so apparently that was real
um meanwhile the feds have nabbed seven thieves who stole 100 million worth of
gold diamonds and rubies and of a uh armored car
so imagine being one of those thieves and you got you got a $100 million worth
of stuff and then you thought you got away with it but you didn't spend any of it
apparently and uh got caught eventually so
so tough break there that was uh they got caught three years
after the heist i feel like you you can't get away with anything
as if there's am I allowed to appoint myself head of the Fed i'll do much
better job than Powell oh Trump is Trump wants to appoint himself the head of the Fed
like like the king that he is anyway
u Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome was taken to the hospital by
ambulance yesterday because of a alleged allergic reaction
to food I think but she's alert and recovering does alert sound good
if if if your only problem was an allergic reaction would they say you're
alert or would they say "Oh you're fine you're recovering fine." Why why do they
have to throw in alert cuz that makes me think she was not
alert like not completely alert or else why
would you even mention it i don't know we'll talk about Brad in a minute um do
you remember Senator Alex Padilla he's the one who speaking of things that make
Christy Dome sick um Alex Padilla the senator he's the one who got taken down
by security because he was trying to ask a loud obnoxious question at a Christine
Gnome event and uh so he got taken down and handcuffed and he was yelling "But
I'm a senator i'm a senator that didn't work so if the uh authorities ever start
handcuffing you don't yell I'm a senator because that doesn't work
i don't know why you can yell but don't yell I'm a senator doesn't work anyway
um Senator Padilla uh gave a speech at Congress on the Senate floor and he
started crying now do you think he would have ever been
elected if if the voters saw him crying over something like that oh my god
yeah don't cry on the Senate floor it's a bad look but he's uh one of the
dramats and the dramcrats are looking for the the best photo op and the most
uh tearful um reaction to the news so if you're a
Republican and something bad happens to you you say
something bad happened i wish that bad thing had not happened we'll have to do
something about that to stop the bad thing from happening but if you're a dramat
you you start crying about oh god what about this what about the immigrants oh
god whoa that's called drama
um there's a story that seems mostly in the just the news outlet
about China and the fake ballots are you following that one now I'm waiting for
other news sources to pick it up and validate it cuz I can't tell how big a
deal this is but the uh the story is that uh Cash Patel found some documents
in the FBI suggesting that the FBI had been alerted um from some source that
China was in 2020 um trying to print a bunch of US election ballots to
um throw the race to Joe Biden now that was about the time the Biden crime
family was taking millions of dollars from China while while Joe Biden was
vice president so did China want Joe Biden to win
probably yes because they they had a little bit of blackmail on them because
of the uh payments uh but that doesn't mean that China was necessarily involved in this plot so the
story is that um there was an indication that China because they had a source um
was going to do this and then the FBI decided that their source was not
credible enough and so they withdrew their warning so they had sent out some
kind of notice and they said oh get rid of that uh never mind
and the reason given was that the source was not confirmed so they didn't they
weren't weren't confident that they had the story right but separately time goes
by and the US uh customs border and protection uh captured about 20,000 fake
driver's licenses uh mostly from Hong Kong and China in July of 2020
and they were allegedly on their way to battleground states in the Midwest
now the uh the uh driver's licenses the fake ones could have been used to give
fake ballots which could have been used to rig an election but we don't quite
have you know all those dots connected so I would say there's an allegation
that China might have been involved in creating or wanting to create some fake ballots but we don't quite have all
those dots connected um but it looks it looks pretty bad and
then part of the story is why did the FBI claim they had the story and then
take it back but that part is hard to judge because I
doubt it's that unusual for something like the FBI to say "Well
we think we've got some information you should know about." And then they look into it a little bit more and find out
maybe that source isn't the best one so we'll withdraw that so some of it looks like business as usual
but it's a provocative story so we don't know how much of this is real or if it
affected the election but it's a quite a story
um meanwhile as you could imagine Israel is uh striking Thran again from the air
and they're going after Iranian regime military targets in Thran but
coincidentally some of those targets happen to be in the same part of the city that allegedly
the Supreme Leader is hiding now I don't know if he's you know really
hiding or where he is or anything else but uh allegedly right after uh Kab or
Ham however you say it their supreme leader after he appeared on live TV um
the Israeli Jets uh struck that very area that he was in not the building but
the area um so the same neighborhood so were they
sending him a message maybe maybe
so it looks like uh maybe we maybe the Israelis know where he is at all times
but uh maybe we just say we know where he is so he'll move
did do you ever think about that when Trump said "We know where you are." You know he said in a truth social thing
they knew where Kmeni was or at least Israel did what if they didn't
if they didn't know where he was but Trump said they did what would they have
to do they'd have to move him because even if they didn't believe it they'd still have
to move him and then maybe they could detect the movement so it could be a
trick i'm just speculating uh it could be that they didn't know where he was
but if they say they know where he he is maybe he'll act differently but also
maybe it'll create some action that they can track and then they can find him so
that might be coming meanwhile um
there's a worry that Iran will try to block the straits of Hormuz where a lot
of the world's oil goes through but uh I was looking at the amuse account on X
and he says that China buys about6 of all the seaborn crude from Iran
and Grock back that up about 16 and uh
China is responsible for nearly all of Iran's um oil exports they buy about 90%
of it so what would happen to China if uh Iran
closes the straits of Hormuz and the answer is
even if uh Iran wanted to punish the western world it doesn't look like they
could do it with the Straits of Hormuz unless they punish their biggest supporter which would be China
so do you think do you think Iran would uh take out one well take out that much
oil from China by closing the straits of Hormuz because once they close it I don't know how long
it would ever take to open it up again so I'm uh I'm curious whether Iran will
go after the Straits of Hormuz because I feel like I feel like China would be you
know tapping them on the shoulder and saying you know that would be the one thing maybe you
shouldn't go after because that would hurt us pretty directly
anyway um I guess there are a couple of oil tankers that are on fire in the
straight but only because they they crashed into each other i don't know how that happens how does an oil tanker
crash into another oil tanker like you couldn't see that coming
there's a reason anyway let's see what uh Trump has been saying about Iran
um apparently the reporting is that Trump is considering quote a range of
options so that feels like news he's considering
a range of options but it's not really news because that's what everybody does
all the time you wake up in the morning and you consider a range of options it
doesn't mean anything but it sounds like news trump has also signaled on uh social
media that uh he wants from Iran unconditional surrender
now is that the way you you talk about Iran
um do do you think that gets them to the negotiating table if you say
unconditional surrender that feels like exactly the opposite of what you would
say if you wanted to talk that's pretty much the end of talking
so what did the Supreme Leader say about that well and also that Trump said that
we know where the Supreme Leader is and we don't plan to kill him quote "At least for now."
Imagine being the supreme leader of Iran and the people who have taken out all of
your generals basically they they found a way to get to all the generals and
they say well we're not going to kill you at least not for now
how would you ever sleep because you would expect this to happen at any moment then
anyway so uh you would not be surprised that the supreme leader of Iran says
that Iran won't surrender so apparently no unconditional surrender
is uh imminent and he says that any US military intervention will bring
irreparable consequences irreparable I say
and uh he says the Iranian uh nation is not one to surrender which I believe I
told you and uh he he says about Trump's uh
comments he goes "Those who are wise never speak to this nation in the language of threats."
And I think that's right in the sense that if you ever wanted to make a deal
with Iran you would never talk to them with words like unconditional surrender
you know you'd say stuff like "Well we just have this one problem with the nuclear program and maybe some of your
ballistic missiles so let's talk about that." But if you say unconditional surrender
you're sort of signaling that you're not going to talk and Iran is signaling back
that they're not going to talk either so I wouldn't expect any kind of you know
peace deal ceasefire breakthrough that's not happening
and uh Iran says that US involvement will lead to allout war
whatever that means so our cyber experts are worried that Iran might try a cyber
attack on the US and the question that I have about that is if it were so easy to
do a cyber attack on the US wouldn't we see a lot more of it i feel like maybe
it's sort of hard to attack the US infrastructure you know maybe China has
some we we hear that China has penetrated basically everything but as Iran and
would China help them and say "Here here's the keys to the car go take down
the grid." I don't know i think I think China will will do what China normally
does which is try to stay out of it that That's the way I'd play it just stay out
of it meanwhile um the Hindustan Times I saw
this in a Mario Mario post uh the Hindustan Times is speculating who might
take over if the Supreme Leader were to let's say have an accident
if something happened to him who would take over and they they always show pictures of the top people who might
take over looking exactly like the guy they would take over for like they have
the same beard they got the same outfit on they they're wearing the same wire rim glasses
i feel like if you if you took out the Supreme Leader they would replace the
Supreme Leader with another Supreme Leader that was so similar to the one
that you just had that you wouldn't even know the difference like you you could go down like five deep into you know
who's who's next in line and the fifth person would just look like the person
who just left and all the people above them just a gray bearded guy with the
same kind of hat and uh the same kind of look and the same attitude and would say
all the same things so if you think
that taking out the top uh domestic leader would get you a good result I
don't think there's any evidence of that it just looks like you would get a a younger matter more angry
you know terrorist it just seems like it would get worse so
I can see why Trump would not want to be rushing to take out the top guy
meanwhile uh both sides are talking about the uh military action like it's a
movie sequel they're they're using movie sequel language like uh and I've never seen so
much marketing talk about a war um so
the Israelis are saying that very soon like maybe today or tomorrow we're going
to see an operation from Assad that makes the uh the pager deal they did
with Hezbollah look like child's play so do you believe that do you believe
that in the next 24 hours uh MSAD will have done some gigantic
you know effective attack that nobody saw coming and it's more impressive than
the pagers blowing up on Ezah well maybe maybe not maybe it's just to
scare the Iran Iranians and uh meanwhile the Iranians say um oh
so what what Mossad said is quote "When the dust settles you're going to see
some surprises on Thursday night and Friday that will make the beeper operation almost seem simple." And then
Iran says that uh Israel is going to have a quote great surprise that the
world will remember for centuries really is there really going to be a great
surprise that the world will remember for centuries and will the Mossad really
have a a new op that's even better than the pagers i don't know sounds a little bit
marketing like well the uh ongoing conversation about
Tulsi Gabbard and Trump is uh continuing
u that's what makes it ongoing um but uh Tulsi Gabbard had apparently said not
too long ago that uh that the intelligence community believed that uh
Iran was not intending to build a nuclear weapon anytime soon but Trump
had been saying that their capability was that they could have it very soon
and so the news said "Hey you guys are disagreeing it looks like we found some
disagreements in the administration that we'll talk about but I don't think they were exactly
talking about the same thing so my take is that uh Tulsi Gabbard was talking
about their decision um that they had not decided to go
nuclear and which might be true might not be true but it was about the decision
whereas Trump's comment was about their ability so I think Tulsi Gabbard would agree
that they have the ability to build a nuclear weapon you know maybe
within a year months or something but that uh that when they did their
original analysis they didn't see the intention now I'm not sure if he can measure
intention so it does make sense that you would worry a little bit more about their
ability you know do they have the ability to do it and so I think Trump is
a little bit closer on what matters you know which is the ability because you
you know if you're if you're depending on their intention they could change their intention any minute and we also
don't know what's happening inside that Fordau underground facility how would we
know what their intention was and even if their intention was to not
build a bomb is it possible that their intention is to go right up to the line
where they could build one any minute now because that would look a lot like
intending to build it but not tactically so I think uh I think Trump's on more
solid ground by just talking about you know whether they could or not
uh meanwhile we're looking at the uh range of options that the US might be
involved in and at the top of the list is the use of
these bunker buster bombs that they say only the US can deliver with their
special bombers and uh they're called mops or massive ordinance penetrators
now I've never heard of any weapon that sounded more sexual than that hey hey
baby you want to see my massive ordinance penetrator
so but that's neither here nor there um but I saw today some experts saying that
it might take half a dozen of those uh MOPs those massive ordinance penetrators
um for each of the facilities now allegedly the US has about 20 of
them and then there's one expert and who knows how many you know who knows if the
experts really know but what if it took half a dozen
for each of the underground facilities i think there are two that they're worrying about especially might be more
um you know what I hear when somebody says it might take me six of these bombs
what do you hear what I hear is it might not work
is that what you hear because if it takes six for each of
those facilities that's a whole lot that's a whole lot like they don't know if it'll work they
don't know if it'll take 20 they don't know if it'll take a 100 they don't know if it'll take one
six if they'd said uh had they said it might take two
then I would think oh they know what they're talking about that you know one will almost certainly get it done but
you might need that second one but when they say it might take six for each of
the each of those uh underground facilities what I hear is we don't know
if this will work so is it possible
that the worst case scenario is that you destroy the front door of the
underground facility but you don't destroy anything that's under there and
then whenever you're done um Iran just digs out the front door and then they go
right back to work how would we know exactly if we had collapsed the
underground facility would we know we
could tell what the bomb damage was on the top of the ground but how would you really know if it got
this stuff underground especially after dropping six of those
you know mother of all bombs on it i don't know so suddenly my confidence
that all you need is the US to say yes and those facilities will go away i'm
not so sure i I feel like the the US involvement would be maybe you know
maybe we could destroy them maybe we couldn't so might be worse if we try and fail
um cuz that would also tell them exactly how deep they have to build it next time
if we if we use up six bombs and four now is still operational
then we're going to have to really rethink things i think that's possible
well Israel says they've destroyed 40% of uh Iran's missile launchers and that
might be true because um the number of missiles that Iran has launched toward
Israel has gone down each night and I guess last night there were only 30 if I
have that right so they went from a few hundred to 100 to 30 that would sort of
suggest that Iran is running out of usable um good missiles so they started with
what were estimated as 2,000 ballistic missiles and allegedly they fired around
400 so far but you wonder why they're not firing the rest of them
are they saving them is it because they're going to save them for one one big hit somewhere or
have their rocket launchers been so degraded that they don't even want to load one on a rocket launcher because it
means the rocket launcher will disappear so we don't know what they're thinking
but uh it does look like their capabilities have been degraded
but they might have plenty left according to the Wall Street Journal uh
Israel is running low on their defensive um arrow interceptors that would be a
certain kind of missile that intercepts the incoming missiles from Iran so you
might have Iran is running out of offensive missiles while well maybe
Israel is running out of defensive missiles but you really can't tell in either case because it's the fog of war
so we don't know what's real and what isn't well Tucker Carlson had a tense
conversation with Ted Cruz on Tucker's podcast
and I guess Ted Cruz is in the camp of uh
wanting the US to be to be militarily involved with the attack on Iran and uh
Tucker is very much against that so Tucker got a real good gotcha on Ted
Cruz when he asked him "Does he know the population of Iran?" And Ted Cruz said
he did not and then Tucker mocked him mercilessly
for wanting to bomb a country and not knowing anything about it the answer is
92 million people so Iran is a big ass country so it's
about a third the size of the United States which is really big and uh then
Tucker asked him if he knew how many ethnicities are in Iran and I think the right answer
is there around a dozen major ones and probably infinite smaller varieties
but uh Ted Cruz did not know the answer to either of those questions but also
didn't seem to think it was terribly important and I'm not sure he's wrong
because if I said to you um Iran has 50 million people or I said to you they
have 150 million people would you have a different idea of what to do
i mean in both cases you would still if you were Ted Cruz in both cases no
matter what that population center was you'd still say you know should we take
out the underground facilities so I'm a little bit on Ted Cruz's side
that he really didn't need to know the details because if you know that there are two or three underground nuclear
sites and you know the history of Iran and Israel and you know you know what
the current military situation is do you really need to know that the best
estimate is they have 92 million people it'd be better if he did but does it
make that much difference i'm gonna say it was a really good gotcha so it was you know it embarrassed
Ted Cruz but I don't think it made that much difference i I feel like he knew
enough to be part of the conversation meanwhile the news loves reporting on
whether the Trump allies are splintered so it looks like uh Charlie Kirk and JD
Vance are on the side of uh Trump has earned the freedom and flexibility to
make the decisions and uh that we would trust whatever Trump does to be America
first that's not a bad opinion um but uh
Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon and some other notable people comic Dave Smith um
are very much uh you know don't get militarily involved now I criticize them
not because I disagree but because I think their opinions are incomplete
they need to tell us what they think it would look like if we allowed the
nuclear facilities to remain and didn't get involved now I don't have an opinion
i'm just observing and predicting but I I do note that the people who
pretend they do have an opinion they're incomplete you you need to say "I I want to walk
away and not be involved and I want Iran to reconstitute its nuclear
um capabilities while they're way more mad at us than they were before."
If if that's your opinion then you should proudly put it out there
but it's not really enough just to say we've been wrong every time we tried to
do um your regime change or nation building because this is a little bit
less than that it's very specific to get rid of the nuclear and the the missile programs
so I don't know if that's enough difference i do respect those opinions by the way
i do respect the opinion that says every time we've tried to do this has been a disaster
that's not crazy it It's hard for me to think of a
counter example where we got all involved militarily in the Middle East and everything worked out great
does that ever happen it feels like it's just this sticky horrible situation that
no matter what you do is bad so you might as well not do anything so I get it i understand their point
meanwhile um a bipartisan group is trying to limit
Trump's ability to make war uh so Thomas Massie said this is not a war and uh
reminds us that the Constitution um doesn't make it does not make it a
Trump one-man show and Tim Kaine Democrat is on the same team that he
wants to he wants Congress to decide who if we go to war and Lindsey Graham is on
the other side um saying that we should be flying with Israel if necessary in
other words if Iran doesn't give us us it doesn't give Israel and the US
everything we want um he thinks we should go in hard militarily
who's right i don't know i don't know i'm not smart enough to know who's right
because it depends a lot on the implementation if it were true
that one bunker buster a piece would solve the whole uh you know nuclear
program question if that were true that would be reasonable argument that you
should go ahead and do it but as soon as you say we might need six a piece it
just doesn't sound doable to me even with our technology so in that case
um it's hard to know which what would work out um meanwhile Iran is uh asking
its people to delete the WhatsApp app from their devices because I'm sure the
Iranians are at this point wondering um how is Israel finding us so easily
and killing all our generals is it because they're trying to communicate on WhatsApp
well do you believe that the US andor Israel
is reading WhatsApp messages um out of Iran
do you think that's happening here's what says this is from the corporate
WhatsApp quote we and now listen to how specific this is so my question would be
are they denying that the US andor Israel have a back door are they denying
all right uh WhatsApp says we do not track your precise location we don't
keep logs of who everyone is messaging and we do not track the personal messages people are sending one another
and we do not provide bulk information to any government
does that seem to you like being a little bit too specific about what they don't do
and was there anywhere in that where it said we don't provide a backdoor to the
United States um CIA which of course the United States would require right is
there any chance that the CIA doesn't have a backdoor to all of the messaging
platforms is there really any chance of that i would say no but I look at WhatsApp's
denial and now you know what you're looking for so they're not denying that there's a
back door here's what they're denying we don't track your precise location
may be true but do they track anybody else's precise location
i believe they don't track mine but they're not interested does that mean they couldn't if they wanted to
i don't know it's kind of specific we don't keep logs of who everyone is messaging well we're not asking about
everyone we're asking if there's a back door that allows them to look at the things that
they know they want to look at that's not everyone's that's not a log of what everyone is
messaging um we do not track the personal messages people are sending one another we don't
track them but do they read them what does it mean to not track them
and we do we do not provide bulk information to any government well it's
not really about bulk information it's about knowing if these specific generals
are in a specific place so I'm going to say that their uh denial
is a little bit too specific so the Iranians probably have a a good
argument for getting rid of that app well who knows how many other apps on their phone are tracking them so it
might be one of several apps that's tracking them what are they going to you do use Telegram or something
all right um in other news the big thing
that the Iranian military stuff uh has done is it makes us forget about Gaza
do you remember when Gaza was you know all we talked about
and then time went by and we talked less about Gaza and there I don't think
there's that much um news and a Gaza well there's probably news but I don't
think the news organizations have that much access to Gaza probably less than they've had but there is some Reuters
report that uh Israeli tanks killed 59 people in Gaza crowd trying to get food
and aid does that sound real do you do you believe that Israel
Israeli tanks killed 59 people in Gaza who are just trying to get food aid and
food and aid does that sound real i don't know i I don't trust it
but uh my larger point is that Gaza is now in the back burner which probably
works to uh Israel's benefit so they can do what they want with less criticism
uh according to the Hill uh Democrats have a little bit of optimism for the first time lately
because their no kings uh event was so successful
now is that as funny to you as it is to me the the no kings event was literally
trying to stop an imaginary thing from happening which is Trump becoming a king
it's literally imaginary it's It's not like he's ignoring the courts if the
courts say you can't do that or you know I mean he he's as aggressive as he could
possibly be but uh as Trump has said it's so hard to get anything done it's hard to imagine
him as a king but uh that's enough to make the Democrats feel positive they
got that no kings thing working that's all they got
well also according to Reuters um Trump has uh now increased the number of
active duty troops on the US Mexico border from 2500 to 80,000 and the the
new thing that um the Trump administration is doing at the border is
they've got these military zones so they have designated that this little sliver
of land when you first come over our border are actually military zones and
that allows the military to arrest people um and detain them that not not
arrest them forever but detain them for the border patrol so apparently that's
working so that was pretty clever another thing that Biden didn't think of
on the uh subject of the big beautiful bill according to the Hill u looks like there
might be a little trouble because the the House you know pass their version but then the Senate gets to mark it up
and make their changes before they send it back to the House and uh apparently
the Republicans are not in agreement on how much to cut Medicaid
and I feel underinformed on this topic because the Democrats have been saying
"You Republicans are going to cut Medicaid." And then the Republicans would say "No we're not trump doesn't
want to do that." And then I read the news that the Senate is trying to cut
Medicaid and uh apparently that's what the current version of the bill does it cuts
Medicaid like quite a bit so my question would be what exactly are
they cutting does that mean that somebody who should be covered is not covered or is it just um what does it do
is it just paying the medical professionals less is it just saying that uh if you're not a citizen you
can't get covered we're we're missing the main part of the story the the story just says they're
going to cut Medicaid does that really tell you anything don't Don't you kind of need to know who
are they cutting and why are they cutting everybody 5%
so you know the hospital has to take less money or are they saying you people
can't be on it and you're citizens i don't know so that's a big question
well according to Reclaim the Net um the Xplatform is suing New York because New
York wants to uh force some kind of moderation disclosure
so they want the XC corporation and presumably other platforms to uh define
how they moderate politically sensitive content such as hate speech
misinformation and extremism now you might say to yourself why does X
care so much about these labeled categories and the answer is that it
would give New York state some uh control over how X categorize things so
basically it would be a like a clever way to uh censor X
um content without doing it directly so X is taking them to court
over in LA um there's a report from Fox News that over a 100 LA looters
ransacked an auto zone and uh what they what the story says is
they wonder if it's a street takeover street takeover
is that a thing so so now there's such a thing as a street takeover
which is so well understood that you can just mention it in a news story without
defining it because I don't know exactly what a street takeover is but I'm
assuming it's a mob that's so big that they can kind of take over the street
and loot it is that what it is because as soon as something like that has a
name where you can say "Oh it looks like looks like we're planning a street
takeover on Thursday." Well you're going to get a lot more of it if it has a name
so that's bad um Craft Hind
says it's going to remove the artificial dyes from its US products by the end of 2027 according to CBS News and uh my
question would be this are the artificial dyes the things that
make the craftiness pro uh products unhealthy isn't it the food itself
now I I suppose it depends which food you're talking about but is craft hinds
notable for creating healthy food and the only problem was uh a couple of food
dyes are banned i feel like they're getting away easy if
all they do is get rid of the food coloring but it's better than nothing
so get rid of that food coloring it apparently it only applies to 10% of
their products um Microsoft and OpenAI according to
Futurism are having a little uh problem negotiating
and you can understand why because OpenAI and Microsoft have this really
sort of complicated relationship and they're trying to trying to adjust it
and you know both companies have you know massive interests because the money is the the dollar amounts are so big but
the one thing that stood out as one of their disagreements is um apparently Microsoft signed a deal
with open AI that if open AI ever achieved uh
artificial general intelligence AGI that would be the better kind of AI than the
kind we have right now we have these large language models but they hallucinate and they they don't reason
so well but if it gets to the point where it can do the theoretical higher
level of thinking uh that would end the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI
now can you believe that Microsoft signed that deal so that's their current
deal and knowing that Open AI and all the
other AI companies are are running as fast as they can to get to AGI
why would Microsoft ever sign a deal that says if they get to the really valuable part of AI that that's when the
the deal falls apart and it and it just disappears no wonder they want to renegotiate that
that just looks like a a contract error and you know in my opinion unless
Microsoft believed that nobody could ever get to that point but they wouldn't be asking to renegotiate it if they
didn't think OpenAI could get there so that might be the biggest mistake
I've ever seen in a contract to to say that it would be the contract would end
if they reached this higher level of AI why in the world why would they agree to
that it's crazy according to uh Zero Hedge there's a uh
survey that says uh by Public Square and Red Balloon that only 13% of California
small businesses say they're happy with their current location 13%
so how bad is my state it's so bad um that it's 40% lower than the national
average so a lot of lot of small businesses wish they were somewhere else but not as bad as California
um but they also have no ability to relocate because it' be too expensive
and blah blah blah so in California 67%
of small businesses say they're either planning a move or considering one or
they feel stuck and want to move but they can't afford it oh my god
California is just garbage at the moment all right ladies and gentlemen that's
