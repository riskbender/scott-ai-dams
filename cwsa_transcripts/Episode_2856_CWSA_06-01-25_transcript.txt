Well, good morning
everybody. Let's see if we can get this
show
rolling. I'll get
this. I got
it. There we go.
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human
brains, all you need for that is a
copper mug or glass, a tanker child to
sign a canine jugger flask, a vessel of
any kind. I'm sluring my I'm slurring my
voice, am I
not? Yeah, there there's definitely
something wrong with my mouth. But uh
anyway, join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dope me today thing that
makes everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now.
Go. All right. Well, apparently in
Austin, there are already uh driverless
Teslas. So, if you're uh if you walk
around in Austin, you're going to see
these driverless cars go by. Not only
are there driverless cars now, which is
really good if you don't like people,
but MIT has developed a pingpong playing
robot, which is better than all the
other pingpong playing robots, I guess,
because we've done this before.
But I'm trying to think of a future life
where I I get an Uber, but there's no
Uber driver, so I don't have to worry
about a person. And then I take it to my
local pingpong emporium, and I I play
with the
robot, and then I take my self-driving
auto cab home. I can avoid people
completely.
That's a That's a good
world. Well, as you know, the New York
Times did a big piece alleging that Elon
Musk is taking all kinds of
drugs. Um, they say he was on ketamine
and ecstasy and mushrooms. And um, Elon
Musk says, "Nope, he's not any drugs at
all. It's fake news." and he was
randomly tested for three years after he
had one one puff of uh weed on the Joe
Rogan show. So, nope. He's uh he's
telling us quite clearly that he is not
on any kinds of drugs and I think they
do keep testing him because of SpaceX.
He did say he tried prescription
ketamine a few years ago and uh but that
wasn't you know that wasn't illegal. So
um here is something exciting in
interesting
engineering. Um I keep telling you that
the most um the most exciting technology
would be holes. You know, like the
Boring Company can make a tunnel, big
hole, but if you could go straight down
and you could go far enough, you could
you could get into all that geothermal.
And apparently there's a new technology
that looks like it can do that. Uh, and
it's a company called Quaz
Energy. And what do they do? They uh
they have a a novel drilling method.
They use a
gyotron, you know, which is how I do it.
It's a device that generates a powerful
high frequency millimeter wave. And
these waves are so intense that they can
literally vaporize rock functioning like
a microwave on steroids that bore deep
into the earth.
Well, if that works,
um, the energy situation on Earth is
really going to change because
presumably if they can make one drill
that can do that, they can make lots of
drills that can do that. So imagine
having unlimited free energy.
free, meaning, you know, might cost you
20 to $40 million to drill the hole, but
once you did, it would be free energy
for just about
ever. Well, Paris is uh probably on fire
still
because the uh French soccer team won a
big victory. Uh the uh what team is it?
the uh Paris to Germans
PSG. I watched that uh match. Oh my
goodness, that was fun. That that was
such a good match. Um it was 4 nothing
or 5 nothing, but it was incredible. And
what do you do when your team wins?
Well, apparently if you've got a big
immigrant um
population and uh people have nothing
else to do, they burn their own
city. So don't go to Paris when Paris is
winning. JP Morgan chased his uh CEO
Jamie Diamond. He was at the uh Reagan
National Economic
Forum and when somebody asked him about
uh stockpiling Bitcoin, he said we
shouldn't be stockpiling Bitcoin. Uh the
the US government should be stockpiling
guns, ammunition, and
drones.
Uh does Jamie Diamond know something we
don't know? Well, he does know that if
we ever got into a a real missile fight
with, you know, a major enemy, we would
be out of missiles in about what, a
week. So, he does know that our
military-industrial complex has not been
doing the job or maybe we gave too much
of it to Ukraine or something, but we
don't really have enough stuff to have a
proper war.
Part of me thinks that's good news
because if we had if we had all the
weapons we needed and all the ammunition
we needed, don't you think we'd be a
little bit more likely to want to start
war? I like the fact that we
don't anyway. Um, and Diamond also says
we should be stockpiling rare earth if
we can get it.
Um, he also doesn't like
immigration. So Jamie Diamond said, "Uh,
immigration, what the hell were we
doing? The bottom 20% of our population,
their wages didn't go up for 20 years.
They're dying seven years younger. Their
schools don't work. America's Americans
are getting sick of it." And then he
blames
Democrats for all of their what he calls
the blue tape instead of the red tape
because he says the Democrats are the
ones that like all the regulations that
kill
business. So he's uh pretty close to a
pretty close to a Republican, but not
there yet. We'll keep watching.
Well, uh, Joe Rogan had, uh, Rockstar
Bono on his show, and Bono thinks that
the, uh, funding cuts to
USAID have already killed 300,000
people. How many of you think that the
funding cuts to
USAID have killed 300,000 people?
Uh, I hope not, but you know, that
sounds a little bit
ridiculous. I'm not even going to fact
check that. But, uh, Rogan tried to
correct them and tell him that USA was a
more of a money laundering operation
than than anything else.
um and said that uh billions of dollars
are missing and that uh Elon Musk said
if any if any of this had been done by a
public company, the company would be
delisted and the executives would be in
jail and then Musk called Bono a
And apparently uh re is now just
a acceptable
word. Not with everybody of
course. Well PBS according to the AP PBS
is going to sue uh the Trump
administration over their
defunding same as NPR. Now, how in the
world can people always find a reason to
sue? You would think that sometimes it
would just be they don't like, but
there wouldn't be anything you could sue
over. So, apparently the lawsuit relies
on the argument that they're being
defunded because their opinions, because
they're a little bit too
liberal.
Now, does the government need a
reason? So, what if that is the
reason? Who
cares? So, anyway, I I'm just amazed
that you can sue over anything, you
know? There should be a whole different
kind of government where there's like a
court that follows the president around
and as soon as the president signs an
executive order, the court says, "Well,
anybody suing us? All right, you are you
are you are all right, we'll make a
judgment now. Uh, we're going to
override you."
But holy cow, how could it be true that
everybody can sue everybody about
everything in the government
anyway? Anyway, don't don't you wonder
what the legal budget is for the
government? How much do you think the
Trump administration spends on lawyers?
It it's got to be a
billion like maybe a billion dollars
just on lawsuits. I mean, it's going to
be a crazy number. I don't
know. Well, allegedly there's according
to
Newsmax, there might be some kind of
geostorm today. The sun might have some
kind of weird effect that could
um affect our our electronics.
How many times have we heard
that? I I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that the sun is
exploding and your your internet's going
to go out, but it seems like it never
does. Am I jinxing
it? Are we really bad at
predicting sunspots and what they will
do? I'm not going to worry about that
one.
Well, Trump has uh done the most
Trumpian thing I've ever heard in my
life. You know how Trump likes the show?
You know, it doesn't matter if it's
technically accurate sometimes, he likes
to put on a show. And apparently he
truth. So, he sent out a message on
truth that uh Joe Biden was murdered in
2020 and replaced with a clone that has
different eye
color. And he really did that. That
that's a real thing that happened in the
real
world.
Now, if it were Monday, and probably
it'll happen Monday, uh the Democrats
will go crazy. It's like, my god, now
he's spreading the rumor that Joe
Biden's a clone. And and I'm thinking to
myself, there were a lot of uh
Republicans who thought Joe Biden was a
clone. There's there's at least one Joe
Biden that was too tall, and we all saw
that one, but that was just a probably
just a body
double. But do you think there's a Joe
Biden clone with a different eye color?
How many of you think that Joe
Biden died and he's he's now a
clone? Well, the best argument against
it is why would you build a clone that
was also
incompetent? If if you wanted to clone
him, you'd clone him with somebody who
could walk and talk. you wouldn't clone
him with somebody who is just as
deeply deeply cognitively impaired as
the original. So, I'm gonna say no on
that. But, it's funny that Trump would
post that. Um, there's a Secret Service
whistleblower according to Senator Josh
Holly who saying, uh, this is in the New
York Post and the Secret Service
whistleblower claims that former
President Biden was so out of it at the
White House that he would quote get lost
in his closet.
Now, I I think I may have predicted some
time ago that the stories about Biden
would start out being a little bit mild
and then they would just get worse and
worse and worse until you until you just
couldn't even believe it. Well, here it
comes. Here it comes. He would get lost
in his own
closet. Okay, you want some more?
Apparently, journalist Olivia Nuzi
um was going to have a show on
Bloomberg, but her show got cancelled at
the last minute because she wrote an
article questioning Biden's health and
suggesting there was a cover up and her
show got cancelled. She got
punished. So, the Daily Mail is writing
about that. So
allegedly Bloomberg literally punished
her for having an accurate story about
Biden. Now do you understand why nobody
could talk about it? It's because the
Democrats would punish you if he talked
about it. All right. Is the same thing
happening on the Republican side? If uh
if someone had some damning story about
Trump, would that get your shows all
cancelled?
And maybe, I don't know, but uh that's
pretty bad. And then uh Byron Donald on
Fox News is talking about the fact that
uh I think there might be some
resistance as Congress is trying to get
Biden's doctor to testify. He says, "We
need to issue subpoenas
immediately for the White House doctor
under Joe Biden and for some of his key
staffers." Now, how much do you think
we'll find out if his doctor actually
testifies in
Congress? Do you think the doctor will
tell the full truth and nothing but the
truth?
Or is it possible that the doctor will
weasle things like, "Well, I didn't see
any problems when I talked to him." Uh,
blah blah blah blah blah. I feel like
it'll be more like that because the
doctor has to protect his own
reputation. Meanwhile, there was an MIT
class president giving a speech at
graduation.
um and ended up getting real political
and said, quote, "We're watching Israel
try to wipe out uh wipe Palestine off
the face of the earth and it's a shame
that MIT is part of it." And I guess uh
people walked out and it became a big
deal. Um, she submitted a fake
speech that was approved before she read
her real
speech, which is a trick I hear that
sometimes people do. Submit a fake
speech before they read the real
one. Anyway, um, here here's the
weirdest headline.
Uh, apparently
China considers
Harvard a party
school. Isn't that funny that the
Harvard is the top party school for the
Chinese? Now, I don't have much to say
about that, but usually in California
when we're talking about the top party
school is something like Chico State.
It's not the It's not the one of the top
Ivy
Leagues, but it it's kind of
insulting. Oh, your best college. We
call it a party school.
Really? Is it that easy for you?
Um, yeah. The top party school outside
of
China. Is that real?
Uh, how many of you think that the
Chinese actually think of Harvard as a
top party school? Does that seem
likely? I'm going to say maybe not.
Maybe
not. Well, according to
Redfin, they uh help you sell your
house. There are nearly half a million
more people selling homes than buying
them right now.
And the six of the top 10 buyers markets
are in
Florida. So I guess all those people who
moved to Florida during the
pandemic have decided that a few years
of uh humidity and they're like, "I'm
out of here." How many of you could
handle the humidity in
Florida? If you spent time there, you
know what I'm talking about. Like in
California, we basically don't have
humidity. You know, it could be super
hot. You don't want to go into it, but
we don't really have
humidity. But Florida, oh my god, it's
hard to walk just to the
car. So, I think a lot of people said to
themselves, "Hey, I like all this
freedom and republicanism, so I'll move
to Florida." And then they found out
that half of the year you want to kill
yourself when you walk
outside. Anyway,
um Trump said he's increasing the steel
tariffs from 25% to
50%. And
um has it been blocked by an activist
judge
yet? I'm completely lost.
So we've got hundreds of
countries and then with within each
country there are
dozens of key
products and then we've
had different uh proposed tariffs on
each of them which first were high and
maybe they got pulled back but they got
delayed. So, every time I read a story
like this, like steel tariffs go from
this to
that, I don't know what is
real. Has it already been blocked by a
activist judge? And if it's been blocked
by the activist judge, has the Supreme
Court already overruled it or will they?
it it's
impossible to just follow the story
about what's happening with uh with
tariffs. So, I feel like that's good for
the stock market because the stock
market can't be sure it's bad because
nobody knows what it is. It's just sort
of
confusing and then it gets boring. If
it's boring and confusing, then the
market can adjust to it. So maybe maybe
that's what's
happening. Well, according to CNN, the
latest inflation numbers are almost
exactly where the Fed would want them,
2.1%. The Fed would like it to be
2%. And that's a seven-month low. That's
basically, like I said, right where the
Fed would want it. Now that's
CNN.
So so far employment looks
good. And then I think there is also oh
the next story is uh according to the
Daily Wire and
NBC personal incomes increased by8% in
April well ahead of the
forecasted.3. CNBC is talking about
that. So employment looks pretty good.
Stock market looks pretty
good. Inflation looks pretty
good. Energy prices are coming
down.
And personal incomes have risen more
than we
thought. At the same time that we're in
the middle of this tariff
chaos, how could any of this be How can
any of this be true?
You know, even I thought that the tariff
stuff would at least temporarily knock
things down and might still, you know,
because the the tariffs are still a
little bit more in our future than in
our
past, but
uh things sure aren't going
well for all that
chaos. Anyway, uh Larry Frink of Black
Rockck, he says the next big thing in
financial assets are that all of your
financial assets will be
tokenized. That means every stock, every
bond, every financial instrument will be
on one general ledger. Now
tokenized means something like a crypto
or a Bitcoin so that everybody would
have public access to look at the ledger
I guess you know much like Bitcoin
now does that make
sense? It it seems like it would uh
maybe make banks unnecessary or
something. You know, once you had all
your ledger and all your money was in
some kind of
public thing that everybody could see
and everybody would have access to,
doesn't that mean that anybody could
lend money and anybody could borrow it
and you could charge interest to anybody
you wanted?
I I feel like
banks, the only thing that's keeping
banks in business is if they have
lobbyists. You know, it seems like the
technology has already gotten to the
point where a traditional bank doesn't
make any sense at all. I mean, think
about the fact that you have more than
one checking
account where you've got one savings
account and one checking account.
Wouldn't it make more
sense if when you have more when you
have money in the bank, they pay you
interest and when you borrow from them,
you pay them interest. It just seems
like there's a way easier way to do
banking. So anyway,
um yeah, I told you that the claims
about Biden are just going to get worse
and worse. Here's another one. So Jake
Tapper, as you know, has his book out,
Original Sin, and his new claim is that
uh I think he said this on Bill Maher
show that Biden's mental deterioration
led to the crisis at the
border. Um and Tapper said, "You're
complimenting it by calling it a
policy." Meaning that he didn't really
have a border policy.
Um he said he said that Senator Bennett
from Colorado went to an event in 2024
where Biden seemed
nonfunctioning. He left the event
thinking this is why our border policy,
our immigration policy was such a mess.
So do you remember thinking as I did? So
you probably had the same thought. What
is wrong with
Biden? like why can't he close the
border? Is it really just
incompetence? And it turns out according
to Jake Tapper and according to Senator
Bennett, it was literally
incompetence. It was actual
incompetence. Now, there were, of
course, lots of people who wanted the
border open, but Biden wasn't one of
them.
Biden wasn't an open border guy, but
they still slipped it past the keeper
and got their open border because he
wasn't capable enough to stop him. I'm
not even sure he knew what was going
on. So that I think that's the most
brutal thing that we've seen. uh because
it's such a direct claim that that the
monstrous problem we had with
immigration was literally caused by
Biden's brain not being functional and
by our news people not calling it out
and by um Democrats lying about
it. So every time you think this is
going to go away, it just gets worse.
And this this might go on for a while.
So, uh, if you're like me, you're
watching the Democrats try to learn and
they're trying to learn what was it we
did wrong last time that cost us, you
know, losing everything. And it seems
like the things they're trying to learn
are from two books. won the Jake Tapper
book with Alex Thompson, original sin
and that basically says that Biden was
incapable and uh it was known to the
insiders. And then there's the uh Ezra
Klein book, I forget his cover or his
coowriter uh called
abundance. Now, abundance is basically
we got to get rid of all these
regulations and obstacles to building
anything because we can't build anything
in this country because there too many
too much blue tape as Jamie Diamond
would say.
So in
summary, if you take these two books
together, the original sin and the
abundance book, the thing that the
Democrats have learned is don't run
incapable candidates with terrible
policies. Yes, that would really help
you. Don't do terrible
policies managed by incapable leaders.
That's pretty much the whole thing. It,
you know, their their backup plan to
Biden was Kla
Harris. I mean, they weren't even trying
to have capable
people and and they didn't even seem to
be trying to have policies that would
make sense, like closing the border. And
you know, I could go on, but that's
that's as far as they've gotten.
Um, and then, uh, Alex Thompson, the
co-writer with Jake Tapper, he was on a,
uh, he was on a podcast where Megan
Mardle, who writes for the Washington
Post,
um, asked how legacy media can avoid
running cover for Democratic presidents
in the future given its bias. Now,
that's a pretty good question from the
Washington Post. So, so uh Megan
McCardle is
acknowledging that the mainstream media
is left-leaning and she's saying, "How
could we
avoid, you know, running cover for
Democrat presidents in the future like
they did with Biden?" And Alex Thompson
said
uh uh I wish I had uh good answers. Um
you know maybe like one of the answers
is you know you know uh get on DC more
and like you know touch
grass. So in other
words, there's nothing that's going to
change and the Democrats are going to
run cover for terrible leaders on the
Democrat side and it's just going to
reproduce. So they they will have more
terrible leaders that they'll tell us
are excellent until they've left the
office and then they'll say, "Uh, let me
write a book about how bad they really
were." Meanwhile, Tim Walsh,
um, he's got some of the worst
advice. I I like him because he's so
pathetic. His advice is that Democrats
should be a little
meaner. They should be meaner and go
scorched earth against Trump. And he
says, uh, the president is a wannabe
dictator.
Now, does that ring does that ring true?
Is is that what they
needed? They got two books telling them
exactly what they
need. What they need is good leaders,
not mentally incapable ones, and good
policies. What does Tim Wall say? We
need to be
meaner. That's the worst advice I've
ever heard. We need to be meaner because
he's going to be a dictator. Oh my god,
they're so lost. Meanwhile, in a new
poll
um by let's see, Breitbart was writing
about this Atlas Intel poll
um it said that Pete Buddha Judge got
over 30% of Democrat voters
uh for 2028 presidential election.
What do you think about that? Do you
think it's his
beard? As soon as Pete Buddhajed grew a
beard, his popularity
doubled. Did anything else change? I'm
not aware of anything else that changed.
He just grew a beard. And I was looking
at the beard and I thought, well, it's
not the best
beard, but it's sort of manly. is sort
of JD
Vanclike. Uh maybe that's all it was.
Maybe he just needed a
beard,
ironically. Anyway, uh Joy Reed
announced that she's launching her own
TV show on
YouTube. And uh why is she putting her
own show on YouTube? Well, in her words,
people want trusted voices.
Is she a trusted
voice? Joy Reed, I wonder if she
actually thinks that about
herself or is that just something she
says cuz it sounds good. I don't
know. Anyway, uh the ex White House
spokesperson, Jen Saki,
um her show on MSNBC is tanking in the
ratings.
Um, so I guess that just went right to
hell. So ratings have plunged according
to Headline USA to humiliating new lows.
Well, I don't know where humiliating is,
but and uh she's bleeding viewers just
one week after moving to the coveted PM
slot formerly held by Rachel
Maddo.
So MSNBC is falling
apart. How many of you saw the video
today of Corey Booker doing exactly the
same salute that uh Elon Musk was
accused of doing
um as a
Nazi. So I won't do the whole salute,
but it's where he he touches his heart
and then he extends his hand. And we
went through weeks and weeks of well
obviously that's a Nazi salute. And then
Cy Booker does it and uh Matt Von
Swall gave gave us a list on acts of all
the entities that did not cover it as
news.
Now, don't you think that'd be news if
Cy Booker did a Nazi salute identical to
the one that they're sure was a Nazi
salute from Elon
Musk? Cuz they're sure it's a Nazi
salute. They're not doubting that at
all. So, here are the entities that did
not talk about it. New York Times, CNN,
Washington Post, MSNBC, NPR, USA Today,
Reuters, Axios, ABC News, and every one
of those made a pretty big deal about it
when it was Elon
Musk. I'll tell you, if you ever
believed that Elon Musk gave a Nazi
salute, you're an
idiot. You're just an idiot. That
there's no way that any smart person
could believe that that happened in the
real world.
Anyway, summer vacation time and
apparently we're getting fewer the US is
getting fewer uh tourists from Canada,
UK, Germany, France and the
Netherlands. Uh to which I say, I wonder
if that
means that the hotels will be empty or
will people just be coming from other
places. I also wonder how long that's
going to last because that that feels
like sort of a one-year situation,
doesn't
it? Like like it doesn't feel like
Canada will now permanently not travel
to the United States. I think it's just
the
headlines and as soon as we get some
kind of tariff thing worked
out, it'll be back to where it was.
Well, the uh CEO of AI company
Anthropic warns that AI could wipe out
half of
uh white collar jobs, entry level white
collar jobs in 5 years. Postmillennial
is talking about this and he says that
most of them are unaware this is about
to happen. But isn't the real question
how many jobs AI will create?
Is there really nobody
who's creating jobs with AI?
Nowhere. You know, I I get that
programmers are more efficient and blah
blah blah blah, but it seems to me that
if you took an ordinary person who has a
certain set of skills and then you gave
them
AI, couldn't they just immediately jump
into jobs that they were otherwise not
capable of doing?
There must be
something that creates jobs where there
were no
jobs. So, I don't know the answer to
that,
but I I think that's our our only hope
is that it creates more jobs than it
takes. Tulsi Gabbard was on Fox, head of
the
DNI, and uh she said that China has made
it very clear that they don't want war.
Um, and you know, we've made it clear we
don't want war. Now, I definitely
believe that about
China because the only thing that could
just totally destroy China would be a
war. And same with the US. The only
thing that could sort of totally destroy
us would be a war. So, it' be the
dumbest thing we ever did, especially
with each other. But China doesn't need
a war.
China can just keep growing its economy
until it dominates everything, which is
a way smarter way to take over the
world. So, uh, no, I don't think China
wants war. I think they want to be
capable of war just in case anybody
takes a run at him. But no, I think
that's the last thing they want.
Uh, speaking of China, according to John
Hayward, Breitbart News, there's an EU
report that finds that China is behind
80% of Russia's sanctions
avoidance. Now, didn't we already know
that? Didn't you assume that China was
the one who was buying um mostly energy,
I assume, from
Russia? And uh so those two are sort of
attached at the hip. And doesn't that
mean that Russia is basically China's
Because if China is buying 80% of
their
oil or probably their gas plus oil,
doesn't that mean that China
essentially controls Russia now? Because
the the whole reason we didn't like the
uh the Russian
pipeline that got blown up is that we
didn't want Europe to be dependent on,
you know, mainly one source of of
energy. But it works the other way, too.
If you're the customer, if you're buying
80% of the
energy from Russia and energy is their
main export,
uh, doesn't that really mean China can
make them do just about anything they
want? Seems that way to
me. So, I don't think that
uh I don't think that Putin's in a good
position. like he he may be in a good
position visav
Ukraine, but he's not in a good position
in the world because China sort of owns
his ass at this point. Seems like it.
Anyway, Greta Tunberg is on a boat and
she's heading to Gaza and
uh so she's going to join the latest
Gazabound freedom
flotillaa and they're going to protest
Israel's
actions. Well, that should solve
everything.
Um, it seems to me that Greta has done
such a great job in other topics that if
she can't end the war in Gaza, I don't
know who
can. So, we'll see if she survives
that. The Times of Israel is reporting
that. Um,
meanwhile, you will not be surprised to
know that the latest push to get a deal
with Hamas looks like it's not going to
work
out, as if it ever could. Um, Steve
Wickoff says Hamas's response to a Gaza
ceasefire proposal is unacceptable.
And you know, there's details, but of
course, you know, you you don't even
need to know the details. You just have
to know that there really is no way that
Hamas is going to make a deal because I
think the the Israelis are offering the
f the following deal. Uh if you
surrender, we'll put you in jail forever
or kill
you. I don't think the Hamas fighters
really have a second play. It's not like
they're going to, you know, they're
they're going to find some new way to,
you know, I don't know, make a better
life.
They the only way they're going to stay
alive is if they keep they keep their uh
hostages and they stay underground. As
soon as they come above ground, things
are not going to go well for them at
all. So, how could there possibly be a
deal? I don't know how there could be.
So, and I don't think they care about
getting their own hostages back. So,
that's probably no big deal, even though
there are lots of
them. Anyway, and then there's some fake
news that came in of
Israel that said that said Israel opened
fire on some civilian crowds. That
appears to not be true based on based on
video of the event.
And in other news, Ukraine is uh ramping
it up and apparently they did a major
drone hit on multiple Russian air
bases. So they're just taking out the
Russian planes on the ground.
Now, that's not good because if they can
reach all of these uh bases, at least
the bases that would be close enough to
threaten
Ukraine, are most of the airplanes just
sort of sitting there on the airport
tarmac because it looked like they could
just destroy them at will if they were
willing to go that deep deeply into
Russia, which apparently they
are. All right. So, that's all I got for
you
today.
Um, there she
is. And, uh, I'm going to say hi to the
locals people
privately. And the rest of you, thanks
for joining. And come back tomorrow,
same time, same place where we'll have
some more fun because on Sunday
especially, what else you got to watch?
It's just me.
All right, locals coming at you.
