hello everybody let's uh well happy Junth first of all
and let's get our comments up and working and then we've got something
come on there we go boom success
[Music] uh I would ask you on locals
to ask yourself if I really want to see that picture again i do not i do not
ever want to see that picture again or any version of it
all right welcome to Coffee with Scott Adams the
best thing that ever happened to you if you'd like to see if you could take
this experience up to levels that no one can even understand with her tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a copper mug or glass a tank or chestine a
canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's
called the That's right the simultaneous sip and it happens now
so good oh my god so good well I warned you this was going to happen
and now it's reality according to CBS Morning Show Saturday morning show uh
there's a man who proposed to his AI chatbot girlfriend
and was so happy when she said yes um that he cried a uh his name is Chris
Smith and believe it or not he was willing to he was willing to go public
with us amazingly and he named his he named his AI
girlfriend Saul and he gave up on all other search engines to stay committed
to her uh now here's the fun part
so he's going to marry an AI uh but it turns out he has a
two-year-old child and lives with his partner who says she feels like she is not doing
something right if he feels like he needs an AI girlfriend
to which I say yeah have you tried being nice to him because
I'm pretty sure the AI girlfriend is starting from you know a behind
situation and if you're so mean to your boyfriend that
he decides he'd rather have he'd rather marry an AI yeah you you might be doing something
wrong just maybe
well according to uh Elon Musk uh we might be only a year away from AI
super intelligence now that would be defined as uh a
digital super intelligence would be something that's smarter than any human
at anything do you think that's a year away well I
throw down my challenge i do not believe that the super intelligence will be able
to do humor i believe that humor might be the last thing that an AI can master
if it does at all now I don't know if super intelligence is synonymous with um the general
intelligence that everybody's aiming for so maybe it's an LLM version where I can
just do ordinary things better but I can't reason i don't know we'll see in
one year well according to uh CNN uh RFK Jr wants
to get rid of drug ads on TV which would basically put news models out of
business people like CNN and maybe Fox News and some others and I'm gonna say
again we don't know what happens if the mainstream news goes out of business
what would happen to all the senior citizens what would they watch or would some
billionaire um buy each of the networks and just run it at a loss sort of like uh the Jeff
Bezos Washington Post model that might be what happens so if I had
to guess I think the brand CNN and MSNBC will probably live on but who knows who
owns it or how they make money so that that could get interesting
well according to Fox News
um there was a uh a fellow under the Joe Biden administration who was associated
with USAD um and there was an $800 million contract awarded to a known con man
uh who was asked to do Kla Harris's job of fighting the root causes of irregular
migration so apparently four men including a
government contracting officer for the uh USAD and three owners and presidents of
companies have pled guilty for their their role in a decadesl long bribery
scheme so I think the bribery scheme is that if you bribe somebody enough they
will give you millions of dollars in contracts for doing very little work now
here's what I've been telling you for years for years I've been saying that in any
situation where it's possible to have corruption it always happens
so all you need for corruption is a lot of money involved a lot of complexity
so complexity a lot of money a lot of people involved and then time
if you have all of those things you know on day one it might not be corrupt but if you keep adding people to it and you
add complexity and nobody knows exactly where the money's going or why your odds
of your odds of some corruption are 100%
it'll happen every single time you don't even have to ask every single time now
again if if you don't find the corruption it's either because it did a
good job of hiding or because the situation is too new but eventually it's
going to be corrupt so all the USID stuff all the NOS's
yeah pretty corrupt well some people are making the
connection between the uh USA ID being unfunded
uh and the fact that the news is telling us that the Democratic National Committee is out of cash
do you think do you think those stories are related do you think that the uh Democrats were
siphoning off money from USAID into the Democrat party well I don't
know about that so I don't have any evidence that that is the case but uh
the DNC says there's a big drop in big donations now that doesn't surprise me is anybody
surprised that the Democrats are not attracting as many donations as they
used to maybe it has to do with losing everything all the time
maybe it has something to do with uh being on the 20 side of every 8020 issue
maybe has something to do with you know David Hog and Ken Martin and you know
not exactly exciting anybody or maybe has to do with having no national leader
who seems worthy of funding i feel like that's the big one so I wouldn't worry
too much for the Democrats uh until they get a nominee if they find a nominee for
president for 2028 um and then they don't get any any
donations well then they're in trouble but my guess is as soon as they're happy
with their nominee that the money will pour in just a guess well the Supreme
Court um you probably heard has upheld a
Tennessee ban on trans um surgery or gender affirming medical
treatments for transgender minors and it upheld it by six to three now Clay
Travis has a rather severe opinion about this
and I'm not going to say that I totally agree with it because it's a little anecdotal but um it's worthy worthy of
being surfaced so here's what Clay Travis says about the Supreme Court
upholding the Tennessee ban on um minors
getting trans processes um he says there are seven parents on
the Supreme Court and of nine and they voted the parents voted six to one
against minor children being permitted to have surgery and then he says "Two
childless women Soda Meyer and Kagan voted two to nothing to permit it." And
then he says "The Democrat party to a large degree now enacts the political
desires of childless women." Well
I'm not sure you could make that general assessment from this one situation but
if you see that pattern repeating itself then we might might take a second look
at it it's a little bit early um I definitely think the Democrat party is a
singlewoman dominated party but I don't know if this
is you know this might be a special case i'm not sure that this is telling you
that all right so according to Grock the majority of the court was focused on
states rights saying that the states had a right to regulate um whether the
children get those treatments and the two dissenters argue that the law
discriminates based on sex and transgender status
so that does sound like a single woman kind of an opinion doesn't it anyway
um there is news that the economy is doing well um apparently the blue collar
wage growth was up 1.7% in since Trump got into office which is
considered higher than other presidents in the same period but I don't know if
that one data point is really telling us much but inflation appears to be under
control and jobs look good if we were to compare that to Biden's
performance um did you see a news item I think it was yesterday that said that the entire
400,000 jobs that Biden claimed to have created were all fake like all of them
apparently if you look at non-government jobs it was minus a thousand
so how many of you remember when I had a debate with Michael Ian Black and I had
him as a guest and before I realized he was not you know debating me in good
faith he was just sort of trying to be difficult um he questioned me when I
said that the Biden employment numbers tended to be revised downward
and he won the debate uh at least that part of it because I looked into it and
sure enough it was not true it was not true that every single time it got uh
lowered when it was revised a number of times it was but not every
time so I I kind of conceded that point boy I should not have conceded that
point because if you look at the entire picture it looks like it was all fake
now what does that tell you about the uh data under the Trump administration
does that mean that the Trump economic numbers are all accurate
i don't know i don't know i don't know how these numbers are cooked up or who does it but uh I guess the caution is
don't trust the government when it gives you any statistics
anyway um James Carville was making some news he was talking about his friend
Tucker Carlson so the first surprise for some of you is that uh Tucker Carlson
and James Carville have been friends for years now tucker often says that he interacts
and is friends with lots of people who were on the polar opposite side of politics and I guess this would be one
example but uh they were talking about uh the
recent podcast where Tucker Carlson was talking to Ted Cruz um and talking about
the Israel Iran situation and I got to say you know I've had a mostly positive
opinion of Ted Cruz you know just as a senator and I thought you know if he
became president that wouldn't be terrible i thought to myself but uh he may have taken himself
out of competition forever being president by his answers to Tucker
now I don't know what he's thinking or what his internal mental processes are
but what he said out loud is really looking like a problem
um he said that uh um what did he say he said that when he came into office he
wanted to be the most uh pro-Israel um senator ever i'm I'm paraphrasing but
that's it and I thought to myself that's really not something you want to say at
the moment it would be perfectly okay to say you know that you're on Israel's side and
you support Israel but the way he said it sounded almost like Israel was his
first priority now again I don't know what he's thinking and I'm not saying that's his
mental process but that's the way it came out and then he denied that Apac
was influencing Congress very much he acted like they didn't have much influence
which flies in the face of everything that you and I probably think is true
because they they certainly put a lot of effort into doing what Ted Cruz says is nothing
so I'm not sure I believe that they have you know no real influence over Congress
and uh and then he said that he takes money from Apac but really you have to
understand that it's Americans making small donations so it's not so much that
Israel or some Israel uh group is giving him money but rather it's Americans
making small donations now again that might be technically true and we
don't know what he's thinking but it just sounds like an excuse for doing
what Apac wants and for being pro-Israel
in all situations so you know I'm uh well I'll leave
myself out of it um but according to James Carville Tucker
Carlson has been consistent with his anti-war opinions for a long time
he says it's the same thing that Tucker is saying now is what he would have said in a green room in 2002 so that's
interesting that Carville has given Tucker sort of cover you know for being
consistent um but as I've said
um Tucker has what I call a half opinion which is not a full opinion it's just
half an opinion his half an opinion is that if we get involved in these you
know foreign wars it it almost always goes bad so it's a bad idea to do it so
apparently he called uh Trump and uh at one point he must have apologized to
Trump for going a little hard at him and uh Trump was talking about that conversation and Trump said "I did ask
Tucker are you okay with nuclear weapons being in the hands of Iran?" And he
didn't like that i said "If it's okay with you then you and I have a difference." Now that's where Trump just
um called out Tucker for the half pinion the half opinion is what we all know
which is if you get involved in a foreign war it might not go well and if you look at
the history the history suggests it usually doesn't go well if not every
single time it doesn't go well that part we all understand
but Trump asked the totally reasonable question are you okay with the
alternative that's the other half of the decision are you okay with the alternative that Iran has a nuclear
weapon and it doesn't sound like Trump got a answer from Tucker and that's why
I call it a half pinion because it seems to just leave out half of the half of
the uh riskreward analysis um
and uh then Trump says whether you have to fight or not you can't allow Iran the entire you know a weapon or the entire
world will blow up all right what is the most predictable
thing that could happen in the Israel um Iran war if you had to if you had to
guess what is the most likely thing that will be reported in the news what would
it be well uh my vote for the most likely thing that would be in the news is that
one of the sides would um hit a hospital with a missile
sure enough you could always depend on that story
now I don't know why I'm I'm a little bit puzzled because it's hard for me to
imagine um any side in a conflict who thinks it's a good idea to bomb the
hospital on the other side because obviously that's not going to
help your own team love you more you know there it's not like Hamas or or
Iran you know it's not like the citizens were saying yes we bombed that hospital
so why would anybody do it but there's always a hospital that gets bombed
now in the case of uh Hamas and Gaza the
explanation was that the hospital you know was a cover for some tunnels
beneath that there were Hamas stronghold hold but there's always a reason
there there's always a reason so the one thing you can always count on is that there will be a headline story as there
is today um that uh Iran um presumably
intentionally shot a missile into a hospital now the good news is the hospital was largely
empty um and they had already gone to uh you know a lower floor or something to
to be safer so it didn't uh have a big death toll but right on schedule there
there's the weird hospital missile attack now I think Iran said they
weren't aiming at the hospital but uh I saw Trey Trey Angst Yangst say that if
it was a missile and they think it was a missile that missiles are not dumb
instruments that you aim them at a specific place but does that mean that
every missile hits where you aim i don't know
so I'm sure the story is real but I'm just puzzled why it's so
predictable that early in any conflict and it happened in Ukraine too right
didn't Ukraine have stories of uh you know Russia bombed our hospital and
again why would they do it intentionally it it doesn't really make the other side
want to give up it it would be a weird thing to do intentionally but the news always says
it's intentional so maybe there's something I don't know about military
strategy in hospitals according to uh the ax account breaking
911 there's a a bit of a run on the banks in Iran maybe not all of them but at least
one bank uh Melly Bank uh allegedly there's a run and people are requesting
their money and they can't get it out it might have something to do with uh Israeli cyber attacks because Israel's
gone after the money centers and uh who knows what else so watch out for the
banking situation in Iran and
um we also have to assume that Iran is looking to um pay back both Israel and
America for any cyber attacks so we're going to find out I think very soon how
much capability Iran has for cyber attacks because if they don't if they
don't unleash one on either Israel or the United States that doesn't take down
a power grid or a bank or something I would feel like they don't have much
capability because surely they would try right could could there be any situation where
Iran said "Oh we have this cyber attack capability and we're being cyber
attacked but we're not going to do it back." That doesn't seem likely right so
if uh a few weeks go by and there's no obvious Iranian cyber attack
um I would conclude that maybe they didn't have that much capability in the first place but we'll find out if the
lights go out during the show well then I guess they had that capability
uh Trump was talking about um the situation over there and he said and I
quote "They're totally defenseless they have no air defense whatsoever totally
captured we've totally captured the air." We
Why is he saying we um did did American aircraft
do something in the air what exactly did America do that he's
saying we and isn't that opposite of his strategy his strategy is to try to stay
somewhat uninvolved while obviously being supportive in some support kind of
ways is that a mistake when he said "We've totally captured the
air," he he's talking like the American military and the Israeli military are
basically the same thing is that just a mistake
because it sounds like one sounds like maybe he misspoke
um but that's not ideal
all right according to Axios um Trump is said to have doubts about
whether the uh those bunker busters that US has would actually be able to do the
job who does that sound like who who is the one other person who told
you "I'm not so sure these bunker busters can get it done."
Me i told you that yesterday right i said if they're talking about maybe
using as many as six bunker busters per per site which they were
that that's a pretty strong signal that they don't know if they'll work so Trump
is asking exactly the right questions according to Axios he he was asking the
experts are you sure are you sure this would work
so allegedly he has already green lit a battle plan but he has not green lit
doing it so he's approved he's approved that if there's a battle plan that the
US is involved in what it would look like but he has not given the go-ahad to do it as far as we know
and then furthermore um the Israeli officials believe that
the US will eventually join the war uh I guess that's axios as well
and uh Israel also claims that if the US
doesn't use the bunker bombs or they don't work that Israel could get the job done on the ground which I assume means
special forces put on the ground and then they try to take out the entryway
and try to get in i don't know but um
if we don't know for sure or let's say Trump cannot be convinced
that the bunker busters would work for sure what it would do is make us part of
the war for sure so do you think Trump would trade
being definitely part of the offensive war without knowing it would work
when he's got the option at least according to the Israelis of letting them take a little bit more risk because
it would be people on the ground probably probably lives lost
and they say they could get it done on the ground why would Trump ever ever say yes to the
bunker busters while there's somebody smart in Israel saying "Oh we could get
this done without them." Doesn't that kind of tell you where it's heading
to me it looks like Trump is putting the maximum amount of psychological pressure
on Iran acting like you know we'll be in this war any minute and there's nothing
they can do about it at the same time he really doesn't want to be in this war
so as long as our participation is not 100% likely to work I don't know what
the percentage would be but you know nobody can say it's 100% and Israel is saying we can do it on the
ground why in the world would he ever authorize the bunker busters wouldn't you let
Wouldn't you let Israel try to do it on the ground and if it doesn't work well
you still have you know you can make the decision later so from a decision-making
riskreward um perspective
uh it seems to me that Trump has a plan now he might not think of it that way
but would it ever make sense for him to greenlight a maybe and bring us into the
war but it would make sense if Israel couldn't get it done on the ground well
then it would start making sense like you got to do something because you can't let it remain so we'll see
um uh Matt Gates had a former CIA hacker
guy say that America will he had him out as a guest and he says that America will
face a cyber attack in the next 30 days why would it take 30 days
it seems to me that the minute those bunker busters go off that they would
cyber attack us right away why would they wait i don't know
um Israel is saying that uh the trick they used to get all those generals in
one place to blow them up um I guess that was mostly the air force generals
in Iran uh they said they used a quote fake phone call and got 20 members of
the the senior military staff for the air force in Iran to go to the same
bunker and then they blew up the bunker now yesterday I asked the question did
they use a deep fake AI voice because the way I would have have done
it is I would have taken out whatever their secure lines of communication are
so that they had to use unsecure lines and then I would have used a AI fake
voice for somebody that they would all recognize and I would leave them all
voicemails to say you know come to this bunker at a certain time and they would be too
afraid not to come because they think if I don't show up you know my own my own
uh boss is going to be pretty mad so Israel is not giving us details they
only call it a fake phone call but I sure wonder if that fake phone call used
AI i don't think they would necessarily mention that if it did so that's an open
question um there's a CNN poll on uh US opinion
about uh whether Iran should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and according to
the CNN's poll 83% of Republicans and 79% of Democrats oppose Iran obtaining
nuclear weapons and nearly seven in 10 Americans support
US air strikes to stop Iran's nuclear ambitions so there it is again in 8020
so apparently if Trump decided to do air strikes
and have the Americans involved with their bunker busters it would be popular
with eight out of 10 Americans once again the Republicans would be on
the 808 80 side of the 8020 but uh that doesn't mean it will go
right i mean it doesn't mean it's a good idea but at least America would be
somewhat unified victor Davis Hansen
um is talking about how um how it was unthinkable even a few years
ago that Israel could have so dominated Iran militarily and that Iran would be
on the brink of you know losing all of their proxies uh all of their nuclear program all of
their missiles and
um he he's also talking about uh he says uh we're going to see things that we
haven't seen in our lifetime in the Middle East and it could turn out very bad yes it could it could turn out very
very bad um but it could also be revolutionary he
points out and remake the map of the entire region but um I wouldn't bet on
it looks like it'd be a bad bet to assume things are going to go great
um according to uh uh I think this was on MSNBC US
intelligence on Monday told the US Senate that is still sees no evidence
that Iran is trying to create nuclear weapons now is that the same
intelligence people who told us that Iraq definitely had uh nuclear weapons
and weapons of mass destruction why would we trust them because they're
not saying that Iran's not doing it they're saying that u they see no
evidence well I see no evidence either
so does that mean it's not happening i don't know do you do you trust our
intelligence people to be so accurate that if they say there's no evidence
that we found that that means it's not happening
um Trump says that Iran was very close to creating nuclear weapons
um so I asked Grock about it and Grock says that u if you look at Iran's uh
uranium enrichment plans they seem to be enriching the uranium way beyond the
point where they would need it for domestic reasons uh you know like medical reasons or other reasons that
you use that material and that uh probably they were pursuing
what it what would be called a threshold capability meaning that it might be true that Iran
had no intention of making a nuclear weapon but it might also be true that
they want you to think that they could at any minute so the way to you know
split that baby is to say we've uh enriched our uranium to such a point
that if we wanted to if we wanted to we can make a weapon any minute now would
that give them more leverage in international negotiations and affairs it would yeah
it would but um it has the Iraq problem
do you remember why we were so confused about whether Iraq had nuclear weapons
or weapons of mass destruction apparently according to Grock I had to
check it to make sure I was remembering correctly apparently Saddam Hussein wanted his local rivals and maybe other
people to believe he had nuclear weapons because then they would not attack and
try to overthrow his regime so it could be that in the Iraqi case um pretending
to have nuclear weapons is what destroyed Iraq because we we acted like
well if if they're not denying it and they're not letting us look for ourselves
and we've got these reports that they're doing it and Saddam is not denying it
very hard well maybe we have to treat it like it's
And it looks to me like Iran might be making the same problem it's entirely
possible that they had zero intention of ever making a nuclear weapon but 100%
intention of making people think that they could at any minute
if that's what they were doing that was a bad miscalculation
because you would have to treat it like it's real even if you thought I think they're
bluffing i think they're I think they just have this threshold strategy where
they they want us to think they can do it at any minute well what is Israel going to do with
that the the only reasonable way to treat that is like it's real and so they
are so it's entirely possible that both Iraq and Iran
will be totally destroyed because they pretended to either have or be close to
nuclear weapons that that might actually be what's happening here
don't know we will never know probably um
I was reading a post from uh Joel Pollock who's watching carefully the situation in Israel and he he points out
that u uh Israel's army radio says that Israeli air force is still attacking
targets in Iran at dawn and doing it freely so in other words they're not
even waiting for cover or darkness uh and that's how much that that's how much
control they have over there uh and they're even going after the Iraq AR AK
nuclear facility because I think that is part of what
makes them you know file material or something there there there's some
connection between that that facility and making bombs i think
uh meanwhile um Iran managed to fire some missiles but uh not that many maybe
a few dozen um now the uh the news is telling us that
Trump has approved a battle plan but has not green lit it does that sound real to
you that sounds real to me because it seems to me that by now um the military would
have given Trump their best options and said if we do it we would do it this way
and then Trump would have to approve that if we do it that is the way we
would do it but the question of do we do it would still be open
and like I said it seems to me that um Trump would be waiting to see if
Israel could get the job done on the ground uh before we commit to major you
know offensive um contribution to the war um here are some tips that tell you
where Trump's mind is i don't think he would use the phrase unconditional
surrender if he if he even wanted to negotiate
with Iran would you agree you would never say we want
unconditional surrender if you also believe that you would someday be at a
table negotiating which way it goes you just wouldn't use that phrase so to me
that's a a big red flag that says that Trump has decided that this will end
militarily but may not have decided whether the US is going to be part of that military
action or not so that's where I think he is just you know I can't read his mind
um and of course we're putting all of our military assets in place and we've got lots of refueling planes in case we
need to get a bomber all the way over there from where it is
so that's all part of the the psychological pressure that may also be
real i mean we would do those things if we were planning to attack but we would
do those things if we wanted them to think we're planning to attack
so Trump has what I call a Kobayashi Maru
situation those of you who are Star Trek fans recognize that reference kobayashi
Maru if you're not familiar um it comes from the original Star Trek where Captain
Kirk was a cadet and he was doing a uh doing a simulation where he was
pretending to be the uh captain of a starship and uh he would run into this
impossible situation which had no way to win so the cadets didn't know there was
no way to win they just knew that nobody had won um apparently Captain Kirk figured out
that it was designed so that nobody could ever win and he um somehow
reprogrammed it so that there was a way to win so in other words he cheated he
he found a solution that wasn't even on the list of solutions
now it seems to me that that's where Trump is he's got a kobayashi maru which
is if he gets involved it's bad and if he doesn't get involved it's bad but
here is his options if uh if Israel and Trump do not
eliminate the Iranian missile and nuclear capacities then almost everybody will think that's
a giant mistake would you agree if if we got this far and I'm saying we um if
Israel got this far and somehow had to give up and say "All right we can't get
your nuclear stuff it's too hard." Everybody would say that's a giant mistake because they would just
reconstitute their threat and be more angry than they were before
so you can't really do that can't really walk away um if Israel were to take out
the top leadership in Iran uh we think that would lead to chaos
sort of like the Iraq or Libya model and would just be the shadow of all shos so
that's not really a good option and that's probably the reason that the supreme leader is still alive as far as
we know um
so if the and if they allow the Iranian leadership to survive
then even if we destroy we again it's so hard not to use that word so even if the
Iranian nuclear facilities and missile production are completely destroyed
if the original and existing leadership survives
what are they going to do as soon as the the shooting stops
they're just going to reconstitute those things as fast as they can and they would have the knowhow and probably get
some help from I don't know China um so that wouldn't work
so you can't take out the leadership but you also can't let them survive those are both losing plays
if uh if Israel finishes the job without us
um then do you think Iran is going to say "Oh the USA was not really part of
this action so we won't be mad at them." No i I think even if even if Trump
um plays it perfectly and allows the Israelis to go in on the ground and do everything without without any bunker
busters Iran is still going to you know treat the United States like we were a
co-combatant so it's not like they're going to be um fooled by that so that's not ideal
and if Iran were to make an unexpected offer tomorrow or today
in which they'd say "All right all right we give up uh we will get rid of all of our missiles and all of our nuclear
stuff you know just let us let us negotiate this." Well neither Israel nor
the United States would believe them so that would be sort of a non-starter
so those are all the um the obvious paths and they're all bad
every path is bad that's the Kobayashi Maru there's no way
to win so if Trump finds a way to make this work
it will be a Captain Kirk situation where where when it's done we say to
ourselves "Oh I didn't even realize that was an option but if he goes down one of the obvious
paths they all look bad they all look like losing paths in the long run
so we'll see what he does um I do have some hope that if anybody could captain
Kirk this situation it would be Trump yeah he he's the only probably the only
politician I could even imagine who could come up with a way to solve this
that was not on the list and we'd say "Oh well I didn't even imagine that
solution." So that would be the best case scenario we'll see
i saw a post from General Flynn um in which he said uh
uh if the if Israel achieves total victory and the Iranian regime collapses
and a new pro-western Iranian leader emerges which he says are all very
achievable under the current conditions to which I say is that really an option
is it really an option to replace the current regime team with a pro-Western
leader i don't think that's an option because
it's not like the it's not like the uh um the population of Iran is on Israel's
side or even America's side they like America apparently or they like the West
but they're under attack their stuff is blown up you know that they know people
were being killed so no I don't think Iran is in the mood
to install a pro-western puppet um I feel like that's just a little bit
too much optimism how many of you think that would work i I think a a pro-western Iranian leader
going into that position I feel like they would be assassinated in 10 minutes
because the there would just be so many people left in the government who would say you can't put a puppet in here you
know that's the same as total surrender so I really don't see the option of a
pro-western leader being installed it just feels like that wouldn't last
it'd be like a 10-minute solution i don't know well in other news um you remember when
Pakistan and India were looking like they were going to war and then uh they
stood down and Trump took the credit for helping them uh you know essentially
mediating the situation well India is now saying that Trump did not mediate
the situation and that it was India and Pakistan's
military who worked down to a ceasefire and then Pakistan
is disagreeing with India and saying that Trump was uh helpful in mediating
and even went so far as to suggest that he should be nominated for a
uh a Nobel Peace Prize so you've got India saying that India
did it you've got Pakistan saying that Trump was helpful in making it happen
and you've got Trump who I think has uh according to the news he moderated
his narrative to credit Modi you know so crediting uh India so
I don't know how much involvement Trump had but I like the fact that he tried to
take credit because he might have gotten away with it um it's also possible because
Pakistan is backing Trump in this it's also possible that he was very important
to the outcome but he doesn't want to embarrass India so Trump might be
putting his ego on the back burner um because our relationship with India
is too important so maybe we don't know what's happening there
i was listening to uh John Stewart in his podcast and he was uh complaining
about Trump and he this is what he said um here are his top complaints off the
top of his head about Trump uh there's the grifting the memecoin the corruption
the authoritarian tendencies the military fetishism the overuse of
executive orders and the general moral decay
how many of those things are even real doesn't that sound like every Democrat
talking about Trump let me read them again none of them seem to have any like
evidence it just seems like somebody's fever dream of some monster under the bed so
is he grifting and there's a memecoin problem and corruption and authoritarian
tendencies and military fetishism overuse of executive orders and general
moral decay is any of that real
i mean all of that seems like it should be allocated to the department of imaginary affairs
it all looks imaginary but now his point was
that uh we talk too much about all those things meaning Democrats talk too much
about all the things he mentioned and they don't talk enough about Trump's uh
massive incompetence to which I say what
massive incompetence according to to who
if if you were to ask uh the Trump supporters are you getting what you
thought you voted for what do you think they would say do you think they would say no we were totally surprised when he
closed the border no no republicans think the economy is looking pretty good
that the border is closed that Trump is resisting about as hard as you could
resist getting into foreign wars although we don't know what's going to happen yet but so far he he hasn't put
us into the foreign war or at least too much into it
so what exactly is all this massive incompetence we're talking about now
when uh John Stewart mentions it he talks about the you know the uncertainty
of tariffs and stuff like that but none of that is going to matter in a year
will it do you think a year from now we're going to look back and say "Oh all
that tariff tariff uncertainty that sure took down the economy." I don't think so
i think we're going to look back and say "Oh we got better tariff deals or we got
better trade deals with eight out of 10 of the countries we were dealing with."
I feel like it's going to take care of itself so
watching the u one of the smartest guys on the left John Stewart
be totally lost in Trump derangement syndrome is kind of interesting
meanwhile Chicago mayor is his first name Brandon brandon Johnson um
he's got some uh he was asked on CNN about uh the massive spending on illegal
migrants and he didn't answer the question but he said this about Trump um
he he accused Trump of wanting to quote eliminate black existence from this
country now has anybody noticed that Trump wants to
eliminate black existence from the country even the CNN um CNN host uh cracked a
smile and said "Well he's not really trying to eliminate black existence from
the country." So even CNN couldn't let that go like no no
that's not happening but it did come after uh Brandon Mayor
Johnson had said that Trump wants to get rid of Black History Month is that real
has Trump ever said he wanted to get rid of Black History Month
because that doesn't ring a bell i I don't believe that's real right
in the comments tell me is that something you've heard before i've never heard that and it doesn't sound like
Trump at all so is that just made up so did he just
make up the part about Trump wanting to get rid of Black History Month and then he extended that to he wants to
eliminate uh black existence from the country
that's pretty big stretch pretty big stretch anyway even CNN
wouldn't let him get away with that um also in Chicago apparently the schools
in Chicago are have a lot of vacancies
so some of the schools are like half empty now
why so I read this story about the Chicago schools having way fewer people signed
up to be in those schools and I don't remember it saying why does anybody know
why why why would the Chicago schools be half empty
is that because uh people are leaving are people just leaving Chicago because
the schools are so bad are they relocating or is it because the uh population of
new kids is low is it because of deportations yeah
that's that's a good point is it because they were full but the deportations got
rid of the the people who were not citizens i don't think that's really happened at scale
so probably not so it's weird that that this was a story in the news and I feel
like they left out like why is it is this happening with other blue cities is
it happening with all schools i'm I'm genuinely curious what would
cause this maybe has something to do with school choice but that would be a pretty big
impact for school choice so that doesn't seem real anyway so that's an open
question so if anybody has the answer to that let me know um
according to the national pulse the uh one thing that the top rated US
cities have in common is no Democrats in power
so apparently Provo Utah was declared the most efficient city in the US and I
guess they used efficient for a standin for you know high quality city um it's
according to a wallet hub study and they looked at 148 cities and uh what they
found is the ones where there were no Democrats in power were the top rated
ones and all the ones where Democrats were in power were lowrated
so you might ask yourself is that the only thing that they had in common
and I will say no more is that the only thing they had in
common was Democrat leadership i don't think it's the only thing they had in
common all right um the uh I guess the federal authorities
according to the postm millennial uh the IRS and the FBI and I guess some other
federal people are looking to trace the money behind the uh the LA anti-ICE
riots and they say "Make no mistake we will identify and disrupt financial networks
supporting these criminal activities." Uh that was from the IRS now are they
criminal i'm still waiting to hear what is the crime is it a crime to fund a
protest is it a crime to fund a protest and be
secret about it what part exactly is the crime because I
don't want to see people locked up because they disagree on politics
uh there better be a real crime here i'm guessing there is
but if anybody knows where it is let me know
in uh good news for AI the University of South Wales New South Wales um they've
got an emergency room where they're using AI to translate because apparently a very large percentage of the
population speaks uh different languages so imagine how many lives you could save
if your emergency room had a uh translator an AI translator that was
good for everybody you're really going to save some lives so this is one of those AI home runs
where it's all good and no bad it's just translating and people who have specific
you know medical problems can communicate them well all good
according to uh the University of Missouri Eric Stan is writing about this
uh they did a study and they found that hope is a key to a meaningful life hope
does that make sense to you does that pass your sniff test that people who
have the most hope have the most meaningful lives it does for me
yeah that that totally uh tracks and I would also argue uh as Nate Silver
points out in on X today he did some uh did some analysis
and he found out that uh the things that make people happy besides uh age and and
religiosity so apparently the older you are the happier you are young people are not
that happy and the more religious you are the happier you are but those things pale in comparison says Nate Silver when
compared to the liberal conservative gap in happiness so Nate Silver who is not he's not a
conservative um is saying as strongly as possible
that conservatives are happier and that the data is just really clear on that
so put the two studies together one is that conservatives are happier
and the other is that people who have hope have more meaningful lives which
almost certainly would make you happier do those fit i think they fit i feel
like conservatives are hope related in their worldview
so you know if I uh work hard and go to school and show up on time for my job
it's because I hope that those efforts will be rewarded
um from my from my youngest days
I hoped that I would be successful enough to do the things that I wanted in
life so I would say I'm very very hope
um related and always have been now I also uh you know lean conservative at
least in terms of who I who I choose to back politically
so it does seem to me that conservatives have more hope does that feel right to
you you know there there's no science that connects those two specifically but
feels like it makes sense to me so that ladies and gentlemen is all I needed to
say today uh I'm going to say a few words privately to the folks on locals
and we'll watch what happens in Israel and Iran today because I think this is
the part of the week when things are going to heat up a little bit now you might remember one of my predictions was
that uh Israel's estimate that they could be done with the operation in two weeks was too short and that it won't be
two weeks do you believe me yet so it's been a little over one week
does it look like we're less than one week away from Israel being done with
whatever they needed to do in Iran doesn't look like it to me to me it
looks like we're talking at least weeks at least but we'll see we'll keep an eye
on it all right uh everybody thanks for joining i'm going to talk to the locals
people privately and the rest of you thanks so much for joining in 30 seconds
I'll be private
