and stocks are up all right all right breezing into the weekend with stocks
are up at the moment could change on a
dime all right all it would take is one post from Elon it would change the whole
market all right let's get our uh comments working and
then Oh that was
[Music]
delightful oh that's right it's Saturday i just realized it's Saturday so so it's
yesterday's stocks are up all right so maybe I'm a little tired this morning
forgot what day it is but welcome to Coffee with Scott Adams
the highlight of human civilization but if you'd like to take it up a notch all
you need for that is a cuper a mug or a glass a tank or chelse a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee
and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better and
allows you to know what day of the week it is it's called coffee simultaneous sip and it happens now
go i can't believe you let me get that far into looking at the stocks before
telling me it's Saturday you probably told me a hundred times
that I didn't see it all right well today given that it is
in fact Saturday uh Owen Gregorian will be hosting right after the show uh a
spaces so you've got to be on X uh I think you have to be on X to use spaces
it's audio only and you can find it by looking at my uh X feed or I've
retweeted it or Owen Gregorian just look for him and you'll find it so that's
right after the show so I I saw a quote um the Wall Street Journal had some
video of the United Airlines CEO somebody named Scott Kirby an excellent
first name um somebody asked him for the best career
advice and his career advice was don't have a plan uh meaning don't have a goal
and he said that in his career everything good was unexpected and he was ready for it but
if you have goals it puts blinders on you so when he says he was ready for it I
looked at his resume and it looks like he had made sure he knew a lot about
airplanes so I think he'd been a mechanic and then he taken some other
more advanced uh college courses so yeah he was ready for it but he wasn't ready
for everything he was probably ready for anything within anything within that
domain [Music]
uh I'm seeing a meme that Putin has offered to negotiate a peace deal
between Trump and Musk well we don't need that anyway so
the only thing I would add to uh United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's
advice is that you make sure your talent stack is nice and
solid so otherwise you will not be ready all right uh let's see is there
any science that they could have uh saved some money on just by asking Scott
oh here's some according to CME science there's a study that showed that
vegetarians are more rebellious and power- hungry than you think now how
many of you would have known that that vegetarians are more rebellious and
power hungry than you think i would have known that and the
reason is that you're starting with a group of people who are willing to
buck you know one of society's strongest cultural norms which is eating
meat it is hard to be a vegetarian i'm a pescatarian at the moment but when I was
a a vegetarian it meant that if you got invited to somebody's
house you had to tell them you can't eat whatever it is they were planning on serving
so I if you just if you simply started with the people who were willing to buck
you know one of the most inconvenient things you could ever buck
because your friends wanted to go to this restaurant but there's nothing you can eat there um you have to be a
certain kind of person to be willing to take on the vegetarian lifestyle so if
you would asked me are vegetarians more rebellious i would have said 'Yeah obviously i mean you're starting with a
rebellious group you You'd be surprised you know it's not It's not like it's
limited to that one thing i'm not sure I would have known
the power hungry part but it applies to me i'm definitely power
hungry but I see power as a tool like
money um if you have power and you have money then you can do good things and
you can do good things for other people so yeah very power hungry according to uh Newsmax
uh McDonald's has decided it's going to stick with DEI but it's going to change
the words so now it's only called inclusion uh actually Bloomberg was
reporting that and uh they say they're not going to change anything in the way
they operate it's also keeping its internal affinity
groups uh where employees with similar backgrounds I guess demographics can
share ideas um and I wonder how is that
legal because they're they're saying it right out loud i mean they're they're not uh
hiding it they're saying we're just changing the words but we're going to operate exactly the
same well I will add one thing that I know from personal experience
uh well semi-personal one uh one level away from
personal is that if you were to apply for a job at
McDonald's you probably will get it so I don't know how much work they have
to put into being diverse because where I work uh or where I live if you were you
know 16 or 20 and you wanted a job at McDonald's if you applied it might take
a few weeks but there's such a high turnover in fast food that you'd
probably get the job and it wouldn't matter you know what color you So this might be the one the one area
where DEI is not such a big deal it's it's neither it's not helping anybody a
lot because everybody can get a job and I think they're very
merit-based so uh McDonald's is you know might be one of those rare exceptions
where all they have to do is keep doing what they're doing it is one of the best places you could ever have your first
first experience as a job well the Wall Street
Journal has a big article about the redesign of self-driving
cars um and the idea is that a self-driving vehicle in the very near
future doesn't need a steering wheel or a dashboard so what if you just started
from scratch and tried to make a self-driving
environment that wasn't you know limited to what a car can do and the first thing
you'll notice is that all of the interesting ideas would not be practical
because they wouldn't be safe so it shows a picture of this amazing
little vansized environment that you say to yourself "Oh man i wouldn't mind
taking a trip if I could just hang around in that cool little well-lit room with good windows and seats those seats
look comfortable." And then you realize they're walking around and you say to yourself "Oh well
they're still going to have to wear seat belts it it's not like you're going to be walking around in your car while it's
driving so I suspect everything except having a big screen where you can all
watch the same show but by the way none of you want to watch the same
show so unless you're in it alone the big screen isn't going to help you a bit
um but I do think that the idea of just walking into your vehicle with a
suitcase and saying "All right vehicle uh I'd like to go visit the Grand Canyon
so make sure you stop for meals and book me some hotels." And the AI just does
all that for you um that would be amazing so that could
be your future any happen any day now all right meanwhile the US economy
has added 139,000 jobs in May beating they
they beat expectations uh according to Steve
Moran and uh that sounds good i I guess
I don't have any comment about that except it looks like good news but do
any of you have the reflex that I've developed which is it doesn't matter how
good the economic news is it only matters how big our deficit is so when I
hear jobs are good blah blah blah jobs are good all I really hear is you're
driving toward the abyss you do not have a solution for
debt it doesn't matter how many jobs there are they'll all be out of work soon
so uh yeah I'm not really moved by good economic news but I suppose it's better
than bad barely it's barely better than bad
um so Adam Schiff decided to weigh in on this Elon Musk Trump issue and
especially about the big beautiful bill the spending bill that's not a spending bill according to Steve Miller and uh
Adam Schiff said on Acts I can't believe I'm saying this but Elon Musk is right
the big beautiful bill is filled with all sorts of hidden and dangerous
far-right pork is it is the big beautiful bill full of
faright pork or is it just farright things that the far right likes like
protecting the border and you know building up the uh defense industry i
don't know so he's the biggest liar in the world so he can just put it out
there and his Democrat followers will say "Huh that thing must be full of
hidden and dangerous far-right pork." But we don't have any examples
and Elon Musk saw that post from Madame Schiff and he said he responded to it saying "A few
things could convince me to reconsider my position more than Adam Schiff
agreeing with me." And uh yeah yeah that was my first impression too it's like
you don't want him on your side [Music]
um so Elon Musk unfollowed Cat Turd well it's about time i unfollowed
Cat Turd a long time ago blocked him all right
um so here here's the uh here's a news item that you didn't need to do any
research on it looks like AI came up with it so the Financial Times is reporting that
allies of Trump and Musk are urging them to repair their relationship seeking to limit the
political and commercial damage now what else are they going to
do their allies it's literally their friends do
they have any allies who are recommending the opposite that maybe
they fight a little harder what kind of a headline is that
so that was on X and I'm thinking what was there any ally of either Musk or
Trump who pulled them aside and said something like you know I I think this
situation really calls for uh more accusations i think you know things are
going well but you should really ramp up the accusations you know the personal
ones the professional ones the ones that could get somebody in jail i don't think
so i've got a feeling that the allies are all "Yeah maybe you should take a day off and cool it a little bit on
this." Well Trump uh is playing it correctly I think and uh so yesterday
Trump wished Elon well and he noted that he's been that Trump has been uh so busy
dealing with Russia Iran and China that he hadn't had any time to think about
their spat now I don't know how true that is but it's a perfect
uh perfect president answer oh I'm working on all these important things can't possibly get involved in that
meanwhile do you remember the Maryland dad so-called Maryland dad who was
accused of being a MS-13 guy and he got deported wrongly wrongly meaning that
the uh court order did not support him being deported
uh or the court did not um now do you remember what I've been saying since
very near the beginning of that saga about the Kilmar Abrego Garcia guy i
kept telling you that what's funny about it is that it started out being he's a
Maryland dad oh sure he's not here legally but you know that's millions of
people are not here legally that's not the biggest problem i mean if he's built a life and you know a lot of people
would be in favor of someday giving him citizenship you know not Republicans of
course but uh it started out with well he's you know a little bit
bad and uh he may he may well be an
MS13 and then you say to yourself "Yeah but any specific crimes?" You know I
don't know if anything's specific and then you find out well he may have beat
his wife with his fists twice but then she said something you
know to mitigate that a little bit and then you say to yourself "Well I wonder
if it's going to get any worse." And then we find out that he was uh pulled
over for human trafficking meaning that he was transporting a car full of people
probably from the border uh presumably illegals and presumably getting paid for
it so now you've got uh illegal trafficking you've got you know beating
your wife you've got maybe you're a member of MS-13 and now he's been uh for reasons I
don't quite understand he's been brought back to the United States which is what
all of his supporters wanted but he's being brought back because
there are like horrible charges that he's he was part of a
larger operating ring where he may have transported you know who knows how many
people so it wasn't just that one car load of people it looks like he was
pretty active in the human trafficking but now there are additional accusations
that are not charges yet that they're they're just claims so a
co-conspirator has allegedly accused him of involvement in the murder of a rival
gang member's mother now there's nothing funny about
murdering a rival gang mother gang member's mother but it is
worse it it it does show that trend of every time we hear from them things are
worse so that's pretty bad uh but no charges have been filed on those claims
which makes them I would say less credible but the fact that the claim
even exists if the police picked you up what
are the odds that one of your co-conspirators would say that you were involved in the murder of a rival gang
member's mother and the answer is low low probably nobody would mention that
at all but uh apparently this gentleman this Maryland dad uh has a
co-conspirator who is willing to accuse him of that uh so that's not ideal
so I think the uh the Trump administration although they made
mistakes you know for the process I would agree with Democrats who say you
know independent of how bad this guy is there have to be some kind of process
that makes sense for everybody and it looks like he got deported
incorrectly uh there was the claim by the Trump administration that once he got to El Salvador hey what can we do
you know it's out of our hands but apparently it didn't take much to get him back
um all it took was all these uh
indictments so he might have the worst uh lawyer in the world i heard uh Alan
Dersawitz saying that if he had been the lawyer he would have said "Let me loose." in some country where there's no
risk but coming back to the United States that almost guarantees he'll be
in jail for the rest of his life and now now if you ask yourself what parts will
people remember now the Democrats will try to
remember that the Republicans did not use the right process and it resulted in somebody
temporarily temporarily being uh deported incorrectly and unlawfully and being in
the wrong prison so that's what they'll remember republicans will remember that they got
a alleged gang member possible possible
uh uh assistant and a murderer uh wife beater you know off the streets and
we'll put him in jail for many years so who won i mean obviously the Maryland
dad lost but who won the the
Trumpers won so hard because while I fully understand
the argument on the other side it just shrinks to nothing doesn't it like are
you going to remember in 10 years that this guy had some you know some kind of
process problem that temporarily put him in the wrong prison he's going to be in
prison no matter how you slice it it looks like I mean we he's innocent until
proven guilty but I've got a feeling they've got some goods so to me it's kind of hilarious
that uh the people trying to help him may have ended up putting him in prison
forever and they're still going to say "Yeah but we were right about that process
part." This is the part that the Democrats get wrong every time they
don't quite understand that being technically right about something doesn't help them at
all it doesn't help at all what what matters to politics and to the country
is what uh Trump understands perfectly which is how does it make you feel
if you feel better because this individual is you know
captive then Republicans win uh if if you feel better because
some process got followed with this one guy and by the way the mistake was only
temporary because it's already been corrected well not much of a feeling
associated with that so they always get the feeling part wrong meanwhile in the
UK where freedom of speech is an illusion um it is now I think it I think
it means it's illegal they have something called the prevent program in the UK government
um that if you speak positively about something called cultural nationalism
uh I think you can be put in jail and uh that would be believing that mass
migration threatens western culture and it's being called a
subcategory of terrorism now can you believe that the
UK is not allowed to say that if we increase our
immigration it will change the culture of our country and maybe not in a way that we
intended or wanted right to
jail but how many of you would ever travel to the
UK i think it's too dangerous um I've never I don't think I've ever
said anything you know that would get me put in jail but I also don't
know wouldn't that be weird imagine you just take a vacation and you're you're
over there in London and you're just I think I'll send out a little post and
you send out a little post and you don't realize that you just broke their speech
laws and next next thing you know you're in jail in the UK just because you
posted something that you could have posted anytime you wanted in the United States well good luck with
them well there's a uh rare I think it's rare nine to nothing Supreme Court
decision uh that sided with an Ohio woman um I
guess she claimed that she was denied a a job or a promotion actually and it
went to an LGBTQ colleague instead and the court
was trying to decide if somebody who's in a majority category because it was a
straight white woman uh whether or not she could sue for
discrimination using the same burden of proof as for those of a minority
group well it turns out that from by a vote of nine to nothing the Supreme
Court decided that straight white women are people too yeah they're also
people so they get to play by the same rules as people yeah they're not
special they're people and so they get to be treated the
same good um then Kathy Griffin uh was on a Don
Lemon podcast and she said quote "I do not
think Trump won in a free and fair election i believe there was tampering i
don't know if it was the Elon connection my gut is telling me that something was up with
that." So uh perfect
so now Rosie O'Donnell and uh Kathy Griffin have both come out saying the
exact same thing that a lot of uh Republicans were saying about the 2020
election and uh they get to say it without any
consequence well I recommend that they storm the capital immediately and uh try
to push the way in so I love the fact that it seems like everything is going
the Republicans's way you know except the big beautiful bill that may be a little hiccup
uh but every time I see a Democrat doubting a election result I think to
myself well if you believe that it's possible for Trump or his allies to have rigged an
election without getting caught by any court because no court has ruled
anything of the type then what would make you think that it was impossible
for that to have happened the other way in 2020 you what would be the argument
that only Trump supporters could rig an election it's either rigable or it's
not now I don't have any evidence that either of those elections were
rigged but if you think that one of them can rig and the other cannot and the
reason that you know that one cannot because the uh court cases didn't
support it that's not much of an argument you you've kind of lost that
argument so thank you Kathy Griffin well if you didn't notice uh or watch
Cash Patel the head of the FBI was on Joe Rogan just recently and uh broke
some news i guess you call it that one of one of the pieces of news he broke is
that um he'd been swatted so the head of the
FBI got swatted now I assume that means that they
actually showed up at the door it seems to me you know far far
more likely they would have just said "Oh that's the FBI's director's house so
it's obviously not real." But maybe they have rules that say they they can't pretend anything's not real unless they
know not pretend but they can't uh they can't act as though something's not real
until they get there and they find out for sure so that's why the swatting works but if you can't get rid of the
swatting when you're the director of the FBI um I don't think you and I are going to
be able to stop it so that's pretty awful well as you know both Dan Bonino
and Cash Patel have maintained that they've seen the Epstein files and it
was definitely a suicide [Music] um now my question would be this if the
only thing you've seen are the files what would make you think the
files are complete and real how would you know that well they would know better than I
would you know whether a document's real and I'm sure the you know it's all been looked at but don't you think if someone
had the ability to kill Epstein and make it look like suicide
hypothetically would they not also have the access to make sure the file didn't show that they killed him
it feels like a little bit incomplete meaning yeah I hear you and I
I believe Bonino and Patel are telling the truth meaning in their opinion based
on everything they've seen it's a slam dunk you know definitely a
suicide but would they know do do you think that just their
experience plus looking at the files would that be enough that that you know
they have the right answer i don't know it's a little bit short for me but
um anyway so he made some more news um he said that
uh that anybody expecting video evidence from Epistine's private island might be
disappointed as no such footage exists to his
knowledge really what exactly does he mean by that
there's no video footage of a celebrity or he's saying there's no
video footage of anything now suppose he said
um Epstein definitely killed himself and also there are no videos and then nobody
has any now I don't I don't don't know if he's saying that it's a little unclear but if he did say that wouldn't
you disbelieve the entire package because if he tells me there's
no videos and there never have been and nobody's had any I'm not going to
believe anything he ever says again now my my current opinion is that
they're straight shooters and they're they're looking out for the American public but I also believe that we live
in a world where sometimes the security apparatus you know the uh the fate of
the country can depend on not telling the the public everything
so if they had to choose and I'm not saying they are but if they had to
choose between keeping a secret that was so dark it would destroy the
country versus telling you the truth because they're truth tellers which
would they do which would a patriot do because I'll I'll give them the uh the benefit of a
doubt I think they've earned that they're both patriots so the thing I worry about is
not that they're honest because I think they are it's just that if you live in a
world where keeping secrets is part of the operational expectation of what you
do I don't know if you can ever trust anybody whose job it is to make sure we
don't find out things we're not supposed to find out right if somebody is a
journalist and they have accessed all the files and maybe you let a few
journalists run free if they all came back and said "All right we've looked at everything." Somehow they would know
that you know that would be a problem would they know uh and they come back and they say "All right we've looked at
everything and uh it looks like it was a suicide and there's no there's no
videotapes." Well I might believe them because they're journalists and they don't have
an interest in keeping a secret and they probably would want to get there first
and have a scoop and all that but if it's your job to determine what the
public hears and what they don't hear that's their jobs
does that give them the uh let's say the right or privilege to lie to the
American people as long as it's in the interest of the American
people and it would be really easy to imagine a set of circumstances where lying would be the
right I hate to say it but the right answer so unfortunately they just have jobs
where you have to say to yourself uh maybe you know maybe what they're saying
is true but you can never know for sure and even even with the journalists you
wouldn't know for sure but you'd feel a lot more comfortable that they had no reason to keep it secret from
you yeah all right and then also uh Cash
said that um the US is working with India to try
to stop some China backed trafficking network so I guess uh India has some
connection to it and if they work through India they have a little better chance of stopping it um and he
suggested Patel did that the Chinese Communist Party is strategically
targeting the US with fentinel to weaken its
population and he notes that there's an absence of fentinel uh deaths in other
countries now are you convinced
you know I don't want to believe that's true but the opioid wars if you you know
if you've looked into the opioid wars you know that the West has targeted uh
them but it wasn't the United States that did that wasn't it the uh UK so why
would the United States be targeted if it's revenge for the opioid wars because
we weren't involved with that right um and the answer would be it just works you could take out an entire
generation of men you could give them cell phones and video games and fentinyl
and next thing you know uh an entire generation is taken out i
don't know i'm going to say it seems probable it does seem probable and one
of the one of the ways you can know it's probable is do you remember uh the uh ex
CIA agent John Kira Kiraau
Kirai last time I u mispronounced his name he contacted me to to correct
me he'll probably do it again um but he pointed out that when he was in
Afghanistan with the CIA he was asking you know why are these giant um
poppy uh farms allowed to operate and the answer was cuz the
heroin is all being sold to Iran and it's a way to weaken Iran and I thought
to myself oh my god we're terrible people but it looks like that's just the
kind of world we live in and the and the uh the risk we'll have to take so given
that there's at least one source that says we would do it to another country
Iran is it much of a stretch to say that China would do it to us nope that is not
a stretch i don't know that it's true but it's not a stretch meanwhile whiskey sales are down
according to one of the executives of Jack Daniels and uh reasons given are uh the
alternatives of uh marijuana weight loss drugs and a lackluster demand from
generation Z so the young people are drinking less but I think there's one other
uh variable that's not mentioned which is age
i don't know that this is true but wouldn't you expect that alcohol use
decreases with age so if the if the new generation is smaller because we've got
this demographic problem wouldn't uh alcohol use just drop
off just because of age i think there would be some effect
there i don't know how big it would be but um we'll talk later about how it affects
crime anyway uh remittances to Mexico have collapsed john Nol and Breitbart is
writing about that so if he didn't know what a remittance is to Mexico as the
the Mexican uh undocumented people come into the United States and make money
they send some of their money back to Mexico and that's called a remittance i
don't know why it's just sending money but uh Trump plans to tax those
remittance but at the moment they're way down it's not entirely clear to me why
they're down um would it be because there are fewer
people here i I thought they you know I don't think we sent back that many Mexicans
did we but anyway remittances are down and uh Trump's planning to put a 3.5%
tax on those remittances so it might make uh $22 billion
uh over the next several years if he does that um Newsmax is reporting that uh
Trump's not happy with surprise uh the Federal Reserve and their their interest
rate uh policies um so Trump says that
Powell head of the Fed is too late he should go for a full point reduction in
interest he goes too late that the Fed is a disaster uh Europe has had 10 rate
cuts we have had none despite him our country is doing great go for the full
point rocket fuel trump posted that on on True
Social all right um now I I don't have an opinion on what is the right amount
of interest rates to be set but it does feel to me that Trump is
a little bit more right than Powell does anybody have that same sort of just
instinct i feel like Powell might be holding back for political reasons that maybe he
doesn't process as political reasons you know you might you might think he has other reasons but I do
worry that our interest rates are not being set by economics does anybody else worry about
that now you could blame Trump and say well if Trump had not been so hard on
Jerome Powell Powell would admit it maybe just on his own lowered interest rates more but there's no evidence of
that because you know in both cases he he would be helping Trump and if he
didn't think that helping Trump was a good idea well we'd be in the same
place so in surprising news
uh Justin News is talking about this alan Dersowitz is urging a pardon or
commuted sentence for uh Galileain Maxwell
Epstein's accomplice now I've been saying for years so most
of you have heard me say this that uh when there's a big legal question I like
to wait for uh Dersowitz because not quite sure how to help you with that
i like to wait for Dersawitz because he always has the cleanest and what I
consider the most reliable answer and you know if you check back later you'll you'll see he's usually right but uh
this one's a weird one so I don't think I can automatically agree with this and
the argument is that uh Maxwell got a stiffer sentence than people who did
similar crimes so I said to myself really is
that true first of all what kind of crime would be similar to
this um so and the second thing is
u you what what is her sentence so she got 20 years in prison and she's been
there how long has she been there four years how long has Galain Maxwell been
in [Music] prison four years five years something like that it's already been a while but
she's got a 20-year sentence and Duroitz thinks that it would be uh
it would make sense to commute her uh her uh sentence now it's been three
years so I'm doing this three years okay now how many of you think that what she
did um fits a three or four year
sentence because it it literally involved trafficking
minors that's a tough argument so so I went to
Grock and I asked if her sentence was on a line with
comparable comparable court cases and and sentences and Grock basically threw
up its uh hands as hands it doesn't show them very often um because there's nobody who did
a crime that's quite like that you know it was over a length of time and involved lots of different variables and
she may or may not have been coerced by Epstein and part of Durowitz's argument
is that uh Maxwell was a victim too so
that she was a victim of Epstein as well as an accomplice now if if that were
true and you could prove it uh it would look like she had no choice with what
she did or she got brainwashed or something but I don't think we've seen
any evidence that points in that direction have we to me she looked like she was a
pretty happy participant yeah we only see pictures but who knows
so the question you must ask yourself is is Durowitz being influenced by any
outside forces and and of course the most
obvious thing that you would say is uh since you already suspect that Maxwell
was part of the you know MSAD um
operation and you also believe that Durowitz quite openly is very
pro-Israel is it too much to imagine that MSAD said "Hey it's time to
see if he could get her out cuz the longer she stays in you know the more
risk we have that she talks and the sooner she gets out the better." Now I
have zero evidence zero evidence that any kind of influence is happening but I
would look and see if any other lawyers have a similar opinion you know
if uh if today you see oh five more lawyers who were in this field of law
had the same opinion that that sentence was too long then I would say oh well I
guess I guess I'm no lawyer so if normal lawyers who are just
observing say it's too long well okay maybe there's something there
but if Alan Dersuitz is the only one who is willing to say anything like this and
he's uh very public you know there's there's no hidden agenda whatsoever but
he's very pro-Israel then you have to ask yourself how much of this is about Galain Maxwell
how much of this is about the law and how much of this is
about whatever influence Alan Duritz might have or or interests i'll say uh
I'll say influence andor interests because he
doesn't seem like the kind of guy who could be pushed around so maybe it just
makes sense to him on some level that we don't quite understand for whatever
reason i I see in the comments somebody saying the CIA yeah you can make the
same argument about uh the CIA being an influence on him if
you believe the CIA was you know somehow involved in the Epstein thing uh I don't
I don't see the evidence for that but it's not a crazy
hypothesis anyway so uh President Trump was asked
about Iran he says "If they enrich uh then we're going to have to do it the
other way." Meaning something military and I don't really want to do it the
other way but we're going to have no choice there's going to be enrichment now that's just a setup for the next
thing I want to talk about so Trump has very clearly said "We're going to bomb
your country unless you give us what we want on giving up your enrichment."
Um related to that I was watching uh a podcast with Matt Gates he was talking
to the author of a book called Future Jihad Terrorist Strategies Against the
West and this was on Newsmax and uh this was Dr ferris I think
Phar Ferris would that be the way you say it anyway so Dr ferris recommended
that Trump give a televised speech directly to the Iranian
people uh and he compared it to Reagan with the Soviet Union now you know what I say whenever I
see an analogy as soon as you see the analogy it feels like there's a there's
a lack of argument because it's not really like Reagan and the Soviet Union the big
difference is that Trump is threatening to bomb Iran any minute now
i don't believe that uh that when Reagan gave his speech you know tear down that
wall I don't believe we were threatening to bomb the Soviet Union any minute now
so you can't really compare those two situations but I thought about it my
first thought was ah that's not going to make any difference you know the Iranian people aren't going to buy that
especially if you have a sword over their head because what would he say i mean he
probably would throw in the threat and if he throws in the threat it's going to make things worse because if the Iranian
public hears uh you need to do this or else you get
bombed that's not going to make friends you know if the idea is to get the uh
get the public on your side that's not going to do it so I don't know how he could do this in the
context of threatening to bomb them at any
minute um but I do think there might be
something to it if he can not mention the bombing because Trump does have a way of
communicating that's unlike anybody else and if he did say the right things at
the right time he might find a way to connect so I think as long as you don't
mention "We're going to bomb you if you don't give us what we want." Just don't mention that at all then you can use the
documentary effect the documentary effect is where there's one side of an argument
presented over a long period of time and there's nobody on the other side that can be very persuasive
so if he gave a speech directly to the Iranian people and uh he made it
persuasive and there wouldn't be any counterargument it would just be his his
speech uh the odds of him having an upside surprisingly good result are
pretty good the downside risk probably nearly nothing as long as
you don't put a threat in there if if he put a thread in there there's no way that's going to
turn out well so I guess I would be cautiously in favor of this if it were
implemented correctly uh my next
story gets to the concept of what I call how lost are the
Democrats uh I love hearing their their best and brightest people you know the
ones who should be helping them correct the ship uh I love hearing them give
advice that really sounds bad uh so CNN's Van Jones said on air
that Trump should investigate and prosecute the Doge staff quote "I don't
think what they're doing is legal." Now he didn't give he didn't give examples of what he thinks are illegal
um but that might be some of the worst advice I've ever
heard because obviously Trump's not going to do that
and all it is is attacking the people who are trying to get something done on behalf of the American people such as
get rid of the fat and bloat and and corruption so once again we have the pattern
developing where Republicans are trying to get something done that would be Doge
and Democrats are trying to use some kind of legal process to prevent them
from getting anything done how do you miss the pattern at this point like even if you're a
Democrat do you not realize that Republicans are trying to get things done sometimes you won't like them but
they're trying to do things that are good for the country and Democrats are almost entirely involved with stopping
any progress in any way it's it's kind of hard to miss the pattern after a while isn't it and you
know Van Jones one of the smartest people who's also a Democrat
um looks like he's falling into the same trap of just saying that this thing
that's probably popular by 8020 in the United States that they should all be
arrested or at least at least
investigated well here's my persuasion lesson on Trump and uh I've told you
before that he's his writing style and his writing ability is never going to
get the credit it deserves but my goodness is he a good
writer and he did a truth social little write up about his ballroom you know the
ballroom is being built at the White House and I just want to read to you uh
Trump's words when he talks about it now keep in mind that because we have you
know fiscal constraints and we've got a deficit problem that if you're the president and you're bragging about your
ballroom uh it doesn't sound good to the public
who thinks "Do you really need a ballroom could we not really cut that
budget?" and you know you can stand in the muddy lawn when we need to do something
outdoors so he he's got this delicate thing that he's trying to manage where
it looks like it might be a vanity project and also we're in the context of
you know a fiscal constraint but he's building a ballroom so he's got to
navigate all of that and uh let me just read what what he wrote
all right he says quote "Just inspected the site of the new ballroom that would
be built compliments of a man known as Donald J trump at the White House for 150 years
presidents and many others have wanted to beautify wanted a beautiful ballroom
but it never got built because nobody previously had any knowledge or experience in doing such things but I do
like maybe nobody else and it will go up quickly and be a
wonderful addition very much in keeping with the magnificent White House itself
uh the these are the quote fun projects I do while thinking about the world
economy the United States China Russia and lots of other countries places and
events it will all be good maybe even great depending on who
is president of the United States now he he uh he basically disarms
you with this sentence uh compliments of a man known as Donald J
trump because that's what that's what's called voicy
um within the writer's world if somebody is voicy it means you can feel their
personality in their writing and you might even say to yourself nobody else would say that nobody else in the world
would use those words and I don't think anybody would like you know no other president would ever write like this so
this is the most voicy uh
optimistic fun way he could ever introduce this thing and then he brags about his ability to build things which
most people would agree that he has right i mean you'd have to be a pretty
hardcore Democrat to say that Trump doesn't know anything about construction i mean really of course he
knows construction so yes he's probably the uh the ideal president for you know
adding a major addition to the White House and then when he gets to the end he talks about this being his fun
project that's not interfering with all of his other stuff with Russia and China
that's what you are thinking so one of the things I teach with writing is if you can say something
that is exactly what your reader is thinking and and then you take it off
the table because they're thinking that they've got a question and then you just sort of automatically answer it that's a
home run in writing so by the time you got to the end you were you probably
would have been thinking you know why are you wasting your time on this when there's so many important things to do
and then he gives you the answer now I don't know if the answer is you know
adequate or true or covers everything it needs to cover but the fact that he
knows when you're going to be wondering and then he supplies the answer to your
wonder that's really good technique so it's voicy as hell and well constructed
in a way that I don't think I just don't think historians are going to fully
appreciate that he's the best writer we've ever had in government probably all right uh I've told you
before the California government uh seems to me a criminal
racket and almost every day there's another story in the news that kind of
bolsters that opinion so according to interesting engineering sujits is writing that uh
there's a new study that reveals the deep corruption in California's clean energy push so apparently the process of
getting everybody on solar uh has created uh let's see what kind of
corruption uh a sobering array of
corruption a sobering array of corruption so
uh I guess there are so here are some of the alleged uh
corrupt practices so shocking abuses of power in
the approval and licensing phases now how many of you are surprised that a
very expensive project has a shocking abuse of power in the approval and
licensing phase meaning the contracts are going to
friends of the people who have the power to allocate the contracts uh let's see it's also as well as the
displacement of indigenous groups okay I don't know about that and also nefarious
patterns of tax evasion or the falsification of information about the
projects now I don't know how much of this is true but every single
time California gets a bunch of money to do something that sounds good on
paper somebody just steals the money it It's like you might as well
just dump it on the ground and let everybody come and grab some so so remember the high-speed rail that
we didn't build anything sound familiar and then there's
all the uh stuff that's not happening and the rebuild of the fire zones and I
mean it's just one thing after another just complete criminal enterprise how could it be
worse is it possible for California to be any worse well they're taking a run
at it uh so the California Senate passed a bill
uh that will allow violent convicts with life sentences to get out of jail now
they have to have served 25 years and been convicted before
26 so you know it's not everybody but what would happen if you release
somebody who is uh spent their entire adult life in prison and the reason that
they were there is because they done something so heinous that you get life in prison
there aren't too many things you get life in prison for uh what do they do they get jobs at
McDonald's there there's not really anything they can do right because it's
not like they're going to get a job at your local construction place will
they so I I don't know too much about the rehabbing people but if you spent
your entire adult life behind bars I don't know if you're
ready so once again dangerous for Californians
all right ladies and gentlemen that is the completion of my planned comments
and as I warned you um Owen Gregorian will be hosting a spaces event on X uh
that will happen in a few minutes after we're done here and uh I invite
everybody to give a listen i usually listen while I'm making myself some breakfast so I'm I'm usually anonymously
listening um and uh I hope you enjoy it and that's all I
got for today so everybody have a good time today i'm going to say just a few
words to locals people before we go so locals people will be private in
