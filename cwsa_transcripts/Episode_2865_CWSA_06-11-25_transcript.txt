what's happening in the stock market it looks like it's a little bit up all
right all right we'll take it let's uh get this show on the road
cuz it's what you deserve
[Music] there we go everything's working now
[Music] good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of Cuban civilization it's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take a chance to take this
experience up to levels that no one can even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a copper mug or a glass a tanker chalice
or stein it's hard for me to say chalice or stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel
of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen right now go
sound is working everything's coming together
well the uh May month of May CPI
uh in other words the inflation measure was 2.4%
which was in line with expectations so if that's what you expected you got
what you wanted uh meanwhile in California it is now
illegal for drivers to hold their phones to view a map
so you can put your phone into a holder you can have it in your pocket but you
can't have it in one hand while you're driving um that should be on a list with
many other things you should not be able to drive while you've got that in your hand
for example say a makeup brush right
would Wouldn't you feel safer if nobody could drive with one hand and put makeup
on with the other yeah that's just one example i'll bet
you could think of another but uh moving on uh the uh House
which would be Congress um well part of Congress is uh launching a probe into
Harvard over their dis well alleged discrimination in hiring uh that's the
Washington Examiner has a story and uh what do you think
do you think when they look into Harvard that they will find any
possible discrimination against white men in hiring
do you think there's any chance that they don't discriminate against white
men of course they do so we'll see uh how much trouble they get into over that
meanwhile uh you might remember reporter uh Terry Moran
who was working for ABC News but he made some unfortunately
highly personal sounding hatred posts about
Stephen Miller and he's also said some bad things about Trump but he was uh put
on some kind of uh leave and now they say ABC says his contract
is up and he will not be renewed so what happens with all these
uh biased news people who get fired for being biased and terrible
how many of them will start their own podcast that becomes wildly economically
successful do any of you think that Don Lemon is
making money on his podcast cuz I kind of doubt it
and what about uh uh what's his name uh Jim
jim uh who always would be yelling at the president for one thing or another
do you think Okasa now Jim Aassa um what
are the odds he's making any money with his podcast
probably not very high and every one of these uh people who get fired from the
mainstream media they have no place to go sort of like me actually same situation
when they get cancelled they end up starting podcasts
i saw um was it Chris Cuomo who was predicting
that uh that even Joe Rogan show would go down in viewership and it would be
because so many people are entering that space and a lot of them are really good
so the idea is that uh the space that you have enjoyed for podcasting will be
full of highly qualified people will be sucking up all the time and attention
that I was taking from you well we'll see we'll see
because the podcasting world is a very different skill
all right what else is going on here oh um so according to the uh Wall Street
Journal as uh being reported here by Zero Hedge um in the final years of the
Biden administration they had launched um the Biden people
had launched an investigation into Elon Musk's uh foreign associates
so they were just apparently they were spying
on who who came and went to Musk's uh
properties from other countries now what crime do you think they were
looking for the answer is any any crime
they were they were looking for anything because uh I think it was already
obvious that Musk was not going to be helpful to Biden
and I think they were just weaponizing government and going after a potential
Trump ally before he was as much a Trump ally and
I guess they didn't find anything cuz nothing came of it but just think of
that the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department
were investigating Musk for nothing
for nothing that there's no there's no allegation
they simply were you know looking into his associates to see if there was
anything they could make something out of god anyway uh over in France
where you thought the French were more open-minded than the rest of us well it
turns out that they would like to classify the X platform as an adult site
because it has a lot of adult content on it um and they want France wants the users
of X to have to show an ID to use the platform now not every time they use it
obviously but I think it uh they're also doing the same thing with Pornhub and
some other uh porn sites so they're being at least they're being consistent
it's not they're it's not that they're going after X in particular
but um apparently there's going to be a little bit of friction there so we'll see
speaking of Musk um there appears to be some kind of uh
understanding that is developing here between Trump and Musk
and uh this started with um we think they had a phone call but uh Musk posted
quote "I regret some of my posts about President Trump last week." Now oh and
he says "They went too far." Now how many of you would call that an
apology he's got regret
and he says why he regrets it because it went too far
is that an apology well you know an apology to your spouse
would have to be a lot deeper and more personal but in in terms of famous
people who you know have thicker skin and they're used to this stuff
that's pretty close sort of it it's in the neighborhood of
an apology it it at least acknowledges that he was in the wrong
which is the important part because you know if you're dealing with Trump and
your your conclusion is okay the problem was all me um I regret it i should not
have done that here's why that's not bad that's not bad it's not
technically an apology but among famous people
it's not bad so um and then I guess Trump was asked if
they if he could ever you know work with Musk again and Trump says uh I guess I
could i guess I could so that would suggest
that maybe there's some kind of agreement going on there that they that they know they're better with each other
than without now this might be related
or it might not be so see if you think this next story is related to the Musk
and uh Trump story so Speaker uh Mike Johnson
um he told uh reporters that Republicans plan to launch a quote multifront war
against the deficit he says "Every dollar matters we're
serious about this the Republican party is doing everything blah blah blah." But then he said and here's the important
part he said uh this re recession package is a critical step and it's one
of many so it's the one and many part that's the important part
uh according to uh speaker Johnson there'll be several of these and they'll
come from the white house who will work together with the uh the work with the administration to cut all the fraud
waste and abuse so what Mike Johnson is saying is that there will be Dogeel like
cuts but that they're going to come in separate packages and it's uh a presumed
understood part of the process now doesn't that sound like something
that Musk would have asked for in order to stand down and stop criticizing the
big beautiful bill i feel like the thing he could have asked for and should have
is um it's one thing if you tell me that this package is not the one that's going
to make all the big cuts but you're going to have to tell me which one does
you you're you're going to have to put something out there that says we are
going to cut expenses with these subsequent spending packages that's what
uh Johnson's saying now I I think this had always been the plan
but I don't remember Mike Johnson saying it as clearly as he's saying it now so
it makes me wonder if the outcome of Elon talking to Trump
uh and getting mad at him and you know maybe hopefully getting over it is that
at some point maybe Speaker Mike Johnson agreed to give a little bit more detail
to the public about how they plan to attack the debt now I don't know if this
is enough so I you know I I would love to tell you oh yeah if they if they have
these subsequent spending bills that they don't call spending bills and they cut them well
we're in good shape i don't know that that will be the case but it's definitely what we needed to hear we all
needed to hear that they have some kind of plan for cutting expenses so that
helps um
according to uh a new study uh sost is talking about
this Eric Nolan um there's a when there's a perceived
social breakdown it fuels the desire for authoritarian
leaders there's a new psychology study that says so
when society is falling apart the uh the members of society are far
more likely to say could I just have a dictator to you know work this out for
us because democracy isn't going to work in this chaos
and uh is there a way they could have saved any money on that study
can you think of anything they could have done instead of doing the study
that would have gotten them to the same conclusion well yes they could have asked Scott
because if you said to me Scott do you think that during times of uh you know
great uncertainty people will want stronger leaders i would have said "Duh
yeah every time." And I didn't even know that was a question of course I will and
if things look like they're going fine what happens then
when things look like they're going fine that's how you elect a Jimmy Carter
you get Jimmy Carter so I thought everybody knew that that when
things look uh uncertain that people want to authoritate authoritarian
leader who can take charge so maybe that's exactly where Trump
needs to be um Trump says uh in a post on Truth
Social he said uh we made a great decision in sending the National Guard
so do you think so u if we had not done so uh LA would have been completely
obliterated the very incompetent governor
he go puts it in quotes governor Gavin Nuscum
and Mayor Karen Bass should be saying "Thank you President Trump you are so
wonderful." Um we would be nothing without you sir
every time he writes it's funny but uh here's what I think we will never know
what would have happened in LA if there had not been National Guard
but are you happy that Trump um went full
authoritarian and went heavy on the law enforcement
through you know the National Guard um are you happy about that
i am i'm happy about it because I don't know if it you know increased or
decreased any any kind of violence i doubt it increased it
it seems kind of unlikely it made it worse but that that's what the Democrats are claiming so I would say during great
uncertainty when uh when our cities are in flame
look back at that psychology study and ask yourself did you want a strong
leader this week or did you want a weak leader this week
and if you're being honest you're probably saying to yourself you know a lot of uh stuff on fire a lot of
uncertainty i wouldn't mind having a strong leader
and Trump stands in and he gives you exactly what you want he is very good at
reading the room so his his timing for
being more assertive as a leader if if that's even possible
um was perfect uh oh I'm running out of ink on my
printer well uh Karen Bass has declared a local
emergency for just one part of LA and so
curfews are in place from 8:00 p.m to 6:00 a.m now why did that take so long
so Trump is there with the National Guard in like no time at all
and the mayor it took until now to come up with this idea of a curfew
if a if a curfew is useful didn't they wait a little little bit too
long or or are these riots supposed to last forever like how long are they
going to last i would think that the you know the natural life you know life of a protest
like this would be I don't know two weeks maximum two weeks
but uh if a curfew helps um I'm going to say why wasn't that the
first thing you did you know once you saw um foreign flags and cars on fire
and graffiti on things wasn't there an earlier time when you
might decide you know what a little bit of a curfew would help
all right well better than nothing so uh Governor Nuome had a little
embarrassment because he planned this major announcement where he put on a
suit and tie and acted like he was a governor and he wanted to say some
things that were bad about Trump mostly uh while using the excuse of the
protests in LA as a reason to talk to the country and uh
first several minutes of his broadcast there was a an audio problem
so it looked really sort of amateur-ish because the audio
didn't work for a while they got it working finally it was a recorded recorded piece um
but it didn't it didn't come off well because it made him look like uh he he
was running a crappy operation there and then there's this weird story
where Nome apparently made the claim that Trump had never called him or
called him back i don't know which one it was but Trump um responded to the claim that he
had never called Nuome by showing uh uh Fox News hostess John Roberts his call
log and there it was uh right on the phone a call log of 16 minutes where he
spoke with Newsome now if you're Newsome
and I get that he's a you know professional liar because he's a politician they're all professional
liars but why would you tell a lie that could so easily be detected
and debunked did he forget he talked to Trump or did
he think nobody would check or did it work because the people who are watching
whatever Trump said are different from the people watching whatever he says so he can make any claim he wants and it
sticks so probably I don't know threearters of his base who
ever heard him say that Trump didn't call they probably still believe he didn't call even though there's a call
log and you know it's a national story that he did so anyway so how is uh MSNBC
handling the coverage of the uh protests
well one of them whose name I don't know uh
he uh he said that he he was reminded of a slavery
and he he's reminded of the slave holders versus the slave catchers
and uh he didn't want to live in a world where citizens were forced to decide if
they should be helping ICE or not helping ICE and so he made an analogy
to slavery and escape slaves now I've
got a little advice for you if you ever hear anybody
bolstering their opinion about a topic by making an analogy to slavery
the Holocaust or Hitler uh and there's probably more I could add
to the list but those are not serious people those are people whose filter
um is just completely broken because you shouldn't need any kind of analogy for
something that's obviously wrong and the argument is enough but why would you
have to make an analogy to slavery if if it were bad
wouldn't you be able to say "Oh let me just describe it and there's nothing else you need to know." You don't need
to know "Well does it share three of 17 points with this historical event that
you know was horrible in its own right?" No anybody who needs to make an analogy
to the Holocaust to Hitler or to slavery
they don't have an argument so they're they're sort of flailing away there
all right here's a story which is in the news but I can't tell if
it's fake news or partial fake news so I'll watch the comments maybe you know
so the the allegation is that the uh
either ICE or Border Patrol um was starting to target Home Depot day
workers now those would be the people who at least where I live um the illegal
immigrants would often gather in the parking lot of Home Depot because people
would um need projects and so you could drive up to the little
group of them and say "I need uh you and you to help me uh dig a ditch today or
put up a rock wall." And then you drive them to your house and they work all day
and then somehow they get home i don't know how and
so the the allegation is that ICE is targeting them and has
targeted them and especially uh in the Paramount area
uh they targeted Home Depot allegedly and
I'm asking you if this is real and that that caused uh the protests
now does that sound true cuz here's the uh here's the problem
there there was one story in April where um there was somebody with a arrest
warrant who was one of the day workers and when either ICE or border patrol I
forget um went to arrest the one who had a you know open arrest warrant they did
what they have told us they have to do which is uh in the process of going
after the one person if it puts them in contact with a bunch of other people who
are illegal but they were not the targeted ones they might get deported
now that's something that ICE and Tom Holman have been saying since the very
start you know and I understand it i don't love it but I understand it that
if your job is ICE um and you're in a room full of people
that you know to be illegal what are you going to do are you going
to ignore it it's still a crime so the part that I
liked about Tom Holman's approach was the worst first
which uh makes me very comfortable and uh if they were if they were
targeting Home Depot people just because it was easy and you know they're
standing right there in public and you'd know exactly what they were
um they're not really the criminals they're not the worst
and it would be really bad publicity you know a bad brand image look for ICE to
be going after the people who literally are standing there saying "Can I help
you build a wall you know can I work for you at you know
below market wages?" They're not really the dangerous ones so I know that uh
many of you are going to say uh ship everybody home there's no such thing as
um anybody should stay if they're illegal i get it but wouldn't you agree
with me that if you were ICE you should stick with your plan of worst first
and the story about the Home Depot would be the opposite of the worst first so I
don't know if the story is even true cuz I I can't imagine ICE saying you
know this whole worst first thing has worked so far but now we got all the bad
ones so we'll start taking the day workers from the parking lot
i don't know doesn't seem like a good plan so I'm going to say that I don't believe
this is real news or that there's something about the news that's you know
undisclosed like you know maybe there were some known gang members within that
group or something but no there's something wrong with that story it just
doesn't fit the known facts
um according to News Nation
federal agents have uh arrested more than 100 people at this big Nebraska
uh food plant Glennon Valley Foods in Omaha and I guess the workers ran for
cover and but they got a hundred of them now is that a case of worst first
and so the question I have is has something changed in the priority of the
deportations and I'm not arguing whether it should or should not at the moment i'm just asking
did something happen where they decided that worst first
did make sense um I certainly understand that if 100 of
them were working at this one Glenn Valley Foods
wouldn't that be 100 jobs that American citizens might have instead
you know that it's indoor work and it seems like it wouldn't take a ton of
training to get somebody to do the jobs within a food plant
so you know I'm not going to say I'm in favor of it or against it
um I'm just wondering if it's a change in strategy
you say you think it's a new sheriff in town move to uh scare scare them into not working
in America in the first place maybe um and MSNBC is reporting that ICE is
going to deploy tactical units to five sanctuary cities run by Democratic
mayors so that would include Seattle Chicago New York Philadelphia and
Northern Virginia now that part seems like business as normal because
the sanctuary cities would presumably be where a lot of the worst of the worst
are so that makes sense um and it does suggest that ICE and Trump are not
backing down because they're going to go right after the bluest cities
so there's something to be said about that
um do you remember L Monica Mccyver she's representative from House of Representatives and she was the one who
was accused of forcibly interfering with the federal law enforcement officers
um Gateway Panda is writing about this and apparently a federal grand jury has
returned a three-count indictment charging her with forcibly impeding and
interfering with federal law enforcement uh at the Delaney Hall Detention Center
in Newark last month and apparently she she's facing a maximum of 17 years in
prison how bad was it
you know when I when I hear the uh the penalties for some things I say to myself
seriously 17 years for a middle-aged woman pushing
somebody in law enforcement now obviously it needs to be illegal to
interfere with law enforcement doing their job so I have no problem with it being illegal but what would be the
appropriate penalty i I don't think it's 17 years
maybe 6 months yeah at most 6 months suspended sentence
yeah so I don't know we'll see um I guess there are according to Fox
News 1,500 protests planned in 50 states
so um PBD was on Fox News and he was
talking about uh it looks like a setup that Democrats are looking for their
next George Floyd moment to frame Trump as a dictator now that's exactly what it
is um I would go further and say what we're in is not a protest but a photo op
competition why once you start thinking of it as a
photo op competition then everything makes sense
so at the moment Trump is winning because the photo ops are
you know guy with Mexican flag on top of a burning car so that that's a photo
that's you know works in Trump's favor so at the moment the photo op
competition is strongly favoring Trump but it would only take
one photo of something that goes the other way before the Democrats could be
you know solidly winning the photo op competition they they just need one one
law enforcement person to put one knee on somebody's back uh they just need
one person to be wounded badly who's a who's a protester they need a short
video of somebody who didn't look too dangerous being you know dragged away
the the photo op contest will get a lot closer than it is at the moment like I
say Trump is you know he's dominating all the photos are uh pro pro wanting a
throw leader to take control but uh keep an eye on that so yes PBD you are
correct it is a photo op competition
so meanwhile uh Rachel Madau living in her world of madness and hallucination
um she she has this uh persuasion method
that I don't know if it has a name but she's trying to convince her viewers
that there's something that she's imagining that they can also see clearly
it's a tough trick so she's operating from pure imagination hallucination and
what she sees is she's calling a clear unambiguous
all doubts have been removed uh Trump is an authoritarian leader who's trying to
take you know full dictator control of the country
now the way she's trying to sell this is not by giving you examples
which would normally be the way you'd sell such a thing it would be like well
he did this and then he did that and then he did this and then he said that
and if you put it all together it looks like he wants to be a dictator
now that would be an actual argument but she's hallucinating that everybody can
see it clearly where
what are you even talking about i is is sending in the National Guard to
temporarily protect the city is that what makes a king
that's a pretty weak king so she uses words to convince people that they
should not question so she doesn't say you know it looks
like there's some risk here that you know this Trump fellow might be trying
to take more power you know that that's the way you talk about the real world you don't know for
sure anything but you say to yourself well there's some risk you know if this
happened and that happened maybe something bad would happen but instead she goes with "It's clear it's certain
it's unambiguous there's now no question about it that he's becoming a dictator
if that's all you have is words that's it just words clear unambiguous
all doubt removed those are not arguments those are words
and that's what she's got just words well CNN's uh Harry Enon uh you know him
because he does a lot of the polls and data stuff on CNN
um is pointing out that uh legal immigrants
in the US people who came here the right way and you either got a citizenship or
they or at least here legally that among the people who are legal immigrants
there's been a 40point shift to the right among immigrant voters so now
Republicans went from way down uh in the minds of uh legal immigrants
to way up uh they even shifted wildly in their
support for President Trump so if you're a legal immigrant
um the odds that you like Trump are pretty good pretty good now I don't know
if it's the same where you live but I know quite a few legal immigrants
and I would say that a solid majority of them are proTrump
um the illegal immigrants probably probably not the same I assume
but but the ones who followed the law and got here the right way they're not looking for trouble you know they're
they're not looking for people coming from their home country you know disrupting their their stores and their
cities they're not looking for that at all they're looking for you know the law
and order and the the country they they thought they were going to so yeah um
that supports my observation that legal immigrants are more likely to want a
little law and order and be more Republican than you your common sense
tells you makes sense that's been my experience
well I was uh wondering yesterday um when a Apple store gets uh looted and
you see the people just grabbing each of the individual phones and ripping them out and running away i said to myself
and to you as well um why are these phones working
you know once once they know they've been stolen so it seems to me that the phone should have some kind of facility
on it that if you took it out of the store illegally it would lock up or you
know or erase itself or something but apparently it's even better than that um
the iPhones sound alarms and then a message reads that it was a
stolen phone and it needs to be where it needs to be returned
so there was a video of a pile of stolen phones just going
and I don't think you could get those phones to do anything else
what's happening the stock market is up looks like it is
anyway so that answered my question um if you were planning on looting a Apple
store doesn't look like that works so well if you're going to take phones don't do it
well here's a uh gigantic story in terms of how it will affect you and the world
bigger than all the rest of the stories and that is uh Wall Street Journal has a
story that uh Google has changed from giving you links
to giving you answers using its own AI so if you wanted to know
you know some kind of news story or something like that instead of giving you a list of news sites
it might open its own AI and just answer the question
so why is that a big deal it's a big deal because most of the news sites
depend on Google search traffic for their own advertising you know
revenue to be triggered by traffic so apparently uh often post uh is almost
invisible now like it doesn't show up in searches because the AI is answering the
questions um the Washington Post looks like it'll take a hit business Insider
is cutting staff due to a reduction in traffic the Atlantic
publication um expects Google traffic to approach
zero wow zero now that has happened before
to uh Breitbart for example uh the reason wasn't AI in that case it was uh
censorship so basically uh Breitbart went from a place that
would show up on uh Google searches to a place that did not and that you know
pretty much just you know decimated uh um Breitbart but they seem to be uh
recovering so we'll see if they're part of the uh problem now what would happen
oh and by the way the Wall Street Journal didn't seem as susceptible
and I understand that because when I when I want to see the Wall Street
Journal um I don't just Google a story i Google
the Wall Street Journal because their brand is so well known so that makes sense that their their
traffic would be you know flatter up because uh you know when you look for
them you're looking for them you're not just looking for a story
anyway um the reason that's such a big thing is
that what would happen if your major news sites
uh lost 50 to 75% of the revenue
would they stay in business and if they didn't stay in business
what would that do to all the social media people like me the podcasters who
look at the traditional news um in part to make fun of it and to
determine what's fake and what's not and to compare it you know the left and the right that whole game might be over it's
entirely possible that the whole concept of going and looking at a news site
that might be a year away from being obsolete
and that's pretty that's pretty extreme well how would I know what's real
who would be looking to find out what the real news is you know as much as we make fun of the
traditional media how would you know what's happening in Iran or what's happening in the Ukraine
war now I know that the the fake news will have lots of stories that are not
you know totally believable and credible but that's part of the process
is comparing it to other stories and you know trying to figure out what's real
and what isn't and sometimes you can you know crawl toward the truth but what if
you didn't have any of that but what if I didn't have a New York Times or
Washington Post or a Wall Street Journal to even look at because they they
couldn't maintain their business model we're right on the right on the edge of
that and then what would happen to Google's AI
when you said "All right I'm not gonna um you know have links to the other sites but the AI will tell me what's
true." How could it do that the AI would only would only be able to look at other
news stories and you know scrape them or steal them or something but the AI
doesn't know what's real the AI can only look at news and then tell you what the
news says so if the Google AI
puts all of the news people in a business which it very well might do and
very quickly then what would this AI do when you ask
it a question about the news it wouldn't be able to answer so we're we're sort of
right on the edge of all public information disappearing
what the hell does that look like if if you didn't have reporters and
independent press and you know there there going to be some things that the independent press can't really afford to
do you know like you know none of the podcasters have their own you know new
news bureau in the Middle East so we may be approaching a really
weird time in human civilization where our sources of news
just disappear because they won't be sustainable google will eat it all the
Google will eat it and then starve to death on its own because it needs the
things that it's eating for its own survival uh just not not company survival but
survival as a news information entity
so interesting times well here's a story about China and the
trade deal uh as you know China and the United States have been talking
productively and uh at least some of the people are
saying good things i think Lutnik is saying that uh the two largest economies
have reached a handshake for a framework so
let me explain how far away that is from a deal there is a trade deal which you
know could take years to get the details right and then above that there would be
a framework which would be something you could agree on that the details have to attach to
but we don't have that we have a handshake
about a framework we have a handshake about a framework of
a deal does that sound like a deal to you
so I don't know i've never uh negotiated a international
trade deal with China so it could be that this is the one and only way to get
there um that everything looks tentative and it's a messy process and people
think you've agreed to one thing but the other side says "No we didn't agree to that." that what was that handshake all
about well that handshake was about the framework it wasn't you know so probably
it's not as nailed down as all the participants would want you to believe
but the things that matter are apparently uh Trump has push hard to get a uh
speedy answer on the the rarer minerals and so far it looks like China would be
willing to do that so that's good you know if if the only thing we got out of
it was that at least in the short run that'd be pretty good and it would make the markets happy etc
but um there's also the question of the tariffs and as of today the reporting is
that the US would have a 55% tariff on China
um whereas China would be 10%
now that part I don't believe i I don't believe there's going to be some kind of
general tariff that's you know five times bigger one direction than the
other does that sound real i don't know i would need to hear more about that to
know how real that is uh there's something about Chinese students being
allowed to to stay i feel like that might have been a big lever because
imagine all the wealthy Chinese leaders whose children were in school or they
wanted them to be in school in the United States once that looked like it was going to go away
i'll bet you President Xi got a lot of phone calls from his buddies um you know
it would be really good if my son or daughter could get back into that school
that they were in so I think that was probably a big leverage point but it's
hard to say and Trump apparently is okay with the
Chinese students um as long as it's you know part of the larger trade bill and so he seems to be
happy about it um I haven't seen anything on fentinel
or IP theft which are really big deals they're also
the things most likely to be ignored in the end so what would you imagine is going to
happen do you think that China will come up with a fentinel
offer that when we look at it we'd say "Oh yeah that'll really take care of it
that'll that'll get rid of the problem." I don't feel like they will i feel like
that that will be the last thing that gets negotiated and because it's the last thing and you
don't want to lose all the gains that you've already made we'll agree to you know any any
thing they say and one of the things they're likely to say is "Oh yeah
we'll uh we'll crack down on those precursors yeah we'll totally do that oh
and and those dealers we'll uh we'll talk to them and we'll tell them they go
to jail or we'll put them in jail if they do anything with fentinol yeah yeah we got it and that will look a lot like
what they've promised in the past and never delivered so I'm expecting
absolutely no fentinel progress when this is all done
i would love to be wrong but I think they can just keep kicking
that can and just ignoring it as long as they want i don't think we're going to
go to war over it so they they kind of have the advantage there
and I don't know what they could possibly promise about IP theft
because how would we police it are they gonna create some kind of you know international court
that uh you know bows to external demands for you know justice that
doesn't sound like China so I don't think we're going to get
anything on IP theft or fentinel but we'll probably get
tariff uh tariff stuff and uh you know
uh rare earth mineral stuff so that's not nothing
um according also to the Wall Street Journal
uh Europe wants uh their versions of AI
to be uh locally obedient so in other words uh the AI
that um let's say chat GBT makes or Nvidia or Purpleity
um would be a sovereign version so everybody would have their own sovereign
AI you know even though there might be you know several different AIs each one
would have to be you know made for that country and
so if you ever thought to yourself well this AI is going to get all the
countries to agree on the history and the facts and all the fake news will go
away i don't think so i don't think any of the fake news is going to go away i
think uh as long as every country has their own AI they'll have their own
histories they'll have their own truth that's where we're headed
now I always tell you there's a new uh lithium battery but here's another one
uh interesting engineering has a story there's another uh solid lithium air
battery that has four times the energy density as the old ones and it breaks
the room temperature performance barrier now
when it comes to batteries there's always going to be some you know inflection point where it's not just you
know a little bit better battery but it just changes everything this one has the potential to be that
kind of a battery because um it would reach the uh it would reach the energy
density of uh gas basically so gasoline
is a good energy density but if you could make this lithium battery four
times more you know energy storage it would be right up there and that would
change everything so I'm not saying this particular battery is going to be the one but you
know once you see that every single day there's another breaking story of a
lithium battery laboratory breakthrough that gives it you know way more power
and way more uh you faster charging and all that
we have some fun stuff ahead of us and batteries are going to be a real big
part of that all right um apparently US oil output is going to
drop um for the first time since uh
since the co now that kind of had to happen right
um Trump's idea was to unleash energy by
you know drill baby drill and making it legal to drill in more places and more
ways and easier to get permits etc but the the obvious problem is that the
more oil we drill the lower the cost of a barrel of oil because you know supply
and demand and then when you reach a certain point which apparently we
reached it doesn't make sense to drill anymore so you can't use that technique to just
keep lowering energy costs you can only only lower it to the point where it
still makes sense to produce the energy and apparently we hit that point so if
you are waiting for the cost of energy to go down
another you know x% probably not you we I think we had some
kind of like floor and below that at least when it comes to the you know the carbon fuels
um probably won't go lower now the good news is that the uh US government uh
working with private industry is really going hard at nuclear energy and
specifically the kind of nuclear plants that don't have the meltdown risk so
they they know how to do that basically at this point and so building the micro
reactors and the even the bigger reactors are using the new technology and the new fuel
we're gonna get to the point it might be I don't know 12 to 20 years from now because
everything takes too long where we're gonna have coming online a massive
amount of lowcost electricity but at the same time there'll be a
massive demand for it through AI but at the same time
and I don't see other people adding this to their uh predictions but my
prediction looks like this at the moment we think we need like you
know I don't know a hundred nuclear power plants just to keep the lights on
because AI is going to use so much power that will just you know it' be almost
impossible to make too much but at the same time we're trying to
create all of that power I think people are trying to figure out how to have AI
that doesn't need that much power and my guess is that by about the same
time all those nuclear power plants come online will be about the same time we
figured out that we don't need that much electricity because we found you know
clever workarounds and you know we we figured out you know take the entire AI
model and put it on your phone and so it's only using your phone electricity after that so I feel like there's a
point in 20 years I don't know when might be in five not
five but probably 15 to 20 where we're going to have a massive amount of
electricity coming online and not really a massive demand anymore
at which point um the cost of energy could come down
that might be the good news all right ladies and gentlemen that is
the end of my prepared statements um I hope you all feel smarter and uh
and a little bit more prepared for the day uh I'm going to talk to the uh
subscribers on locals privately for a minute the rest of you thank you so much
for joining and I hope you come back tomorrow same time same place where we'll solve whatever problems are left
in this weird world all right local subscribers coming at you privately in
30 seconds
