not looking so good so forget about that
let's uh do a show don't think about your stocks
no don't
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but
for those of you who would like to take this experience up to levels that no one
can understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a
cup of mug or a glass a tanker chalice or ste a canteen jug or flask vessel of
any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for
the unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the
simultaneous it happens now go
sublime so good well
I need a fact check on this i saw online somebody was printing what was allegedly
Elon Musk's medical report showing that he had no drug use is that real
does anybody know if that's real because it wasn't on his account it was somebody else's account
i don't know but we'll uh we'll put a pin in that i don't know if that's real
well according to live science uh there's now an EV battery
thanks to the Brits that can recharge in 18 seconds and apparently it's been
approved for mass production so it's actually coming it doesn't say
how what kind of u you know distance you get but imagine fully recharging your
battery in 18 seconds that's current technology
i'll tell you this this battery stuff is going to change everything
in other power news uh obviously we'll talk about Israel and Iran in a moment
but uh Trump uh fired Biden's nuclear regulator i guess there was a nuclear
regulator according to the Daily Color News Foundation and uh Trump got rid of him so uh
apparently that one person might have been slowing down approvals that's just
my guess but uh Trump is very serious about making nuclear power work so uh I
don't know how many regulations he has to get rid of or how many people he has
to fire but there does seem to be some some will and ability to do both so
nuclear it's coming here's a problem we wish we had all
right if you think of all the problems that the United States has or whatever country you're in um apparently over in
Spain Portugal and Italy there are major protests against over tourism
over tourism now I get it because you don't want too
much traffic and you know it interferes with your life but
I wouldn't mind living in a country where your biggest problem is too many people want to visit because it's so
nice that'd be a good problem so uh Italy
Portugal and Spain I feel your pain but not very much
you've got you've got a pretty good problem there all right let's talk about Trump and
Iran all right today's goal is I'm going to teach you how hypnotists
um analyze people's speech so I'm going to talk about all the things that Trump
has said and done and signaled and then we're going to figure out what comes
next because prediction is the closest you
can get to reality if you're good at it all right so here are the things we know
we know that Trump left early from the G7 some people are saying it was an excuse
to get out of some awkward meetings at the G7 but I don't think that Trump
would do that so my guess is that the reason he left is exactly what they said
it was which is uh there's something that's going to go down in Iran and it's
big and he needed to be fully engaged in that
so that's your first hint second hint um Trump said the other day to evacuate
Thran now is Tan where the Ford nuclear
facility is no um how many of the
nuclear facilities are in Thyron well I don't know but it's not going to
whatever happens in Thran would not directly destroy the nuclear capacity of
Iran so what is it that would be happening in Thran
h all right that's your second clue so one clue Trump left early got all of his
people together in the situation room something big is going down and something about Tran
um and when asked why he was calling for the evacuation of Tran he gave his uh
his usual Trumpian answer uh he wants people to be safe
well obviously um Trump is filled in on some plans that
Israel has for Tran so that much we know he He's not
guessing he He didn't randomly pick a city and say you should evacuate obviously
Trump has been filled in on some plans for Thran
um according to uh Mcronone of France and
Trump says this is not true um Mcronone said that Trump left the G7 to work on a
ceasefire agreement a ceasefire but Trump uh called out Mcronone and
said that he doesn't want a ceasefire he's he's going for something much
bigger now what would be bigger than a ceasefire
well um he says over and over again Iran can't have a nuclear weapon
so here are the things we know something big is going to happen fairly soon it
involves Thran or Tehran am I saying it right um which would only indirectly
be about the nuclear program because it's not really it's not like all in
Tran and it's not about his ceasefire
which you'd expect if he planned to have negotiations
um and a reporter asked uh Trump on the plane uh what are you looking for here
and Trump said "An end." A real end not a ceasefire an end
an end an end to what an end to the
regime an end to the danger an end to the nuclear program well an end
um and we know that uh Trump has now taken a opposite position from Tulsi
Gabbard who had recently said that uh according to the CIA
that Iran was not that close to a nuclear weapon but uh Trump has adopted
the uh Netanyahu messaging that uh Iran was very close
very close so that's a difference um and then Trump said about Iran who
apparently Iran has been trying to contact the United States via other indirect
um channels and wants to talk but Trump
says they'd like to talk but they should have done that before
so is Trump saying very clearly that something's going to happen and
it's going to happen with or without talking because the talking it's too
late looks like it so there's something going to happen and it looks like u Iran's
apparent willingness to talk is not going to affect Trump too much
um and then Trump said uh that if there's any injury
to our troops we'll come down so hard if they do anything to our people I think
they know not to touch our troops now
as you know there have been uh lots of wars that were started with fake
provocations so now that Trump has laid down this red line and said if you do anything to our
troops then we would get involved in the war is that a trick because we can always
claim that they did something that endangered our troops doesn't it feel like there's
enough fuzziness there that we could say "Oh this one missile came really close
to this embassy or something."
So we're starting to put it all together but there's more
um according to Axios um
that according to Axios uh having a meeting with the Iranians would be a
makeorb breakak moment for whether the US will join the war against Iran so
Axios is suggesting there might be some kind of a meeting but if Iran doesn't
give up everything as in its nuclear program um then that would be the go time for
the US to join the war now that's Axios
do you think Axios knows that Trump has planned to join the war
in a way that would you know pretty much require Iran to attack American
interests i don't know um
and uh what else trump sees uh the bunker buster decision as an inflection
point so Trump is still considering the question of providing bunker busters
according to Axios we don't know if that's true and uh apparently Trump has
asked VP Vance and the Middle East envoy to offer to meet with the Iranians next
week for the New York Times so do you think the offers to meet and
to talk are real because he already said you better
evacuate to run because it sounds like something's going to happen with or
without those conversations and he's not going to wait till next week because
remember Israel wanted to be done in two weeks so they're not going to say "Hey
how about next week we have a meeting?" I don't think that will change much action
well Bill O'Reilly said that uh earlier today he had texted with Trump and he
says Trump doesn't want to use American air power at this point and that would be the bunker busters um because that
would cause some problems with China and Putin would it and he'd rather have the
Iranians surrender which he believes they will surrender huh now surrender is
not a word that I've heard before in this context
um so here's a reframe it seems like Trump is reframing it so that Iran gets
to decide if the US enters the war um which might not be a big change to
anybody's thinking but it does kind of put Iran in the decision-making seat um
so the current decision is the US is not in the war or at least in in the most
aggressive way that it could be and now the decision kind of comes down to Iran
if they don't give up their nuclear program like right away um it looks like Trump is willing at
least in terms of the messaging we don't know what he's thinking but in terms of the messaging
he would be willing to enter all right so what would make Iran surrender
that hasn't happened already so if you put it all together here's my prediction
um I don't think Trump wants to use the bunker busters because that would look
like we enter the war and you know that would be bad for his base he would lose support in the US etc but
it does seem that Trump is willing to um let's say I don't want to say allow
but not stop Israel from doing what Israel wants to do
so how could Israel um dismantle the uh Iranian nuclear
program if they do not have access to the bunker buster bombs
and I can only think of one way and I think this is the heest
technique that the uh word that tells you what's happening is surrender
so my guess is that Israel is getting ready to pound Thran and take out each
pillar of the government's power until there's nothing left
and I think that might work because if he wants the administration to surrender
he's going to have to put pressure on him that's different from just bombing some things and then waiting to see what
happens so um my guess
and this is just my speculation at this point my prediction is that the plan is
not to do boner busters but it's to get the Iranian regime to surrender
now would the current regime surrender
not likely not likely at all so how could Israel
get a surrender if the current regime is unwilling to surrender
well um I would call it the chewing from below decapitation strike if they go
right to decapitation and they take out the leadership with the next set of
bombs that's going to look too aggressive and uh might set a precedent etc but
what Israel's been doing so far is getting rid of all the lower level
people all well the top level people in the military but in terms of the um
domestic non-military leadership I think they're just going to start chewing them
up from the bottom up so you get rid of you know an institution you'll get rid
of a you know a minor leader another minor leader another minor leader and
you just start working your way up to the top because apparently they know where everybody is somehow and they know
how to kill them all because they've they've assassinated a tremendous number of leaders
so my guess is that tan will become sort
of a killing field for Iranian leadership but it will start at the
bottom of what they can get to and they'll just start slowly working their
way up until either the top people are overthrown which might happen but I
wouldn't bet on it or the top people say "All right we're out we surrender um
we're going to give up all of our nuclear weapons well nuclear facilities not weapons
and so I would argue that there's exactly one path
if you rule out the bunker busters which I think would be bad idea for Trump to
use the bunker busters but you you don't rule out that under all conditions
Israel will get rid of the nuclear threat which I think is the case what's
that leave all it leaves is decapitation but like I said starting from the top
would be too big of a shock to the system i think they'll start chewing them up from the bottom up so you should
see strategic hits in Thran against you know government sources of power um and
it will just keep going and there will be no end to it and the entire time
Trump will say you know you shouldn't negotiate it but if at any time the
Iranian leadership says "All right all right we agree in advance before we even
sit down that we will dismantle our entire nuclear program." At that point
maybe the bombs will stop maybe but I'm not even sure if Israel would trust them
to you know it would just look like they're it's a delay tactic so that's my
uh that's my prediction a chew them up from the bottom decapitation sort of a slow
decapitation until they get a surrender what else could it be that's that's all
that's left apparently according to uh some news uh
Iran has been urgently signaling that they want an end to the hostilities of course they do um
but probably we assume they're just stalling that's what Israel would say
and I think they're probably right based on history
so um yeah so that's what's going to happen um
according to uh a retired colonel Lieutenant Colonel on Fox News
uh the Iranian missiles are overwhelming the US defense systems
you know our Iron Dome and it looks like there's a uh the Iranians have a
strategy that seems to be pretty good which is they launch a whole bunch of
missiles at the same time and some of them are the good kind and some of them are the cheap kind but the uh the
defensive systems get kind of overwhelmed and then the good kind can snick through so the question would be
will Iran continue going as hard as they can with as many missiles as they can
shoot until they run out which would be pretty devastating uh or do they have to
save them because they might be running low well we don't know it's fog of war
and it's hard to know what's true but uh I would guess that the more the more the
Iranians send missiles into Israel the more damage Israel can do to Thran and
to their leadership with something that looks like justification
so Iran doesn't have too many good options here all right so that's enough
on that um the Minnesota shooter as you know got
caught but if you don't mind I'm not really going to talk about that Minnesota shooter guy because that looks
like crazy guy um it does look like he might have been a little bit more right
leaning than left but he had a long list of people he wanted to get to and they weren't all Democrats and you know so to
me that's just crazy guy and that's that's the whole story there all right
but as you know the uh proTrump um
what would you call it the proTrump supporters are having a uh tough time
because the the anti-war people and the let's go get them people on different
sides so among the u no war no way would
be Steve Bannon he would be the most prominent one doesn't want a war with
Iran tucker Carlson who's going hard at Mark Leven
he's got a real problem with Mark Lean on Fox News i guess Mark Leven is more
pro-war uh M gates wants to avoid uh further war with Iran
marjgery Taylor Green um and then of course Thomas Massie you would not be
surprised wants a resolution to require Congress to approve the war and he's
already got three Democrats to sign up bernie Roana and AOC
so whatever Trump does is either going to make um one half of his coalition
hate him or the other half hate him because his two choices are get involved
in the war and then he loses you know half of his support or don't get
involved in the war and then he loses half of his support so if you're Trump
how do you play that well that goes back to my prediction if
he if he simply says "All we're doing is um you know maybe helping helping Israel
avoid some missiles but Israel goes wild in Tehran and just keeps murdering
um and assassinating leaders." I feel like in the end
that might be enough to keep his coalition together because it would not be the United States jumping into the
war but also it would not be avoiding the war it would be allowing uh I keep
saying allowing as if as if they work for us but they don't it would be let's
say standing back while Israel does what Israel thinks it needs to do so I feel
like the only way he can wiggle out of this you know there's there's no way to win is by letting Israel carry the
entire load and just sort of you know being a let's say a bad cop
somebody said uh you know is Israel being the the bad cop and Trump is a
good cop kind of kind of Trump Trump is still the one who's saying you know you
just have to negotiate and you just have to surrender and then everything's fine
so there's a little bit of a good cop bad cop thing going on which might be productive so here's my question for you
if uh if Trump managed to pull this off and pulling it off would be stepping
back while Israel does what it needs to do and there's no bunker buster but they
get um Iran to say "Look we'll we'll unlock Ford and we'll let you watch
while we dismantle it." Would that be enough to keep uh Trump's um coalition
together i think it would be because it would look like we got away
with um something we wanted strategically but we would get away with
it on the cheap so I feel like there's only one path and
it's through the leadership of the uh Iranian people
and I don't see any other path all right um I I just want to give a
compliment to comic Dave Smith
um one of the things that's fascinating about this whole podcasting world is
that some people have made a name for themselves and become you know they
became relevant in these top level conversations simply by
force of will I guess so why would we listen to comic Dave Smith's opinion
about geopolitical uh stuff
and the answer is it doesn't make sense on the surface but he did such a good job comic David
Smith did of inserting himself in the conversation and debating people who
wanted to debate and you know making his his views known that he is actually
relevant um and I have to admit I'm very impressed with that um he's not the only
one i mean a number of podcasters and I'm one of them have through just hard
work and showing up every day and you know trying to add something to the process have made themselves
um not the most important thing in the conversation but relevant relevant and I
was wondering are there more humorous that are supporting Trump than there
have been supporting Republicans in the past cuz I was thinking you know um
you've got Tim Dylan you've got Roseanne you've got me uh comic Dave Smith i feel
like I feel like there are a whole bunch of people who are humorists first who
have become relevant in the the Trump era and it feels like Yeah joe Rogan
right yeah obviously Joe Rogan and a number of the other comedians as well uh
Adam Corolla exactly yeah i'm forgetting a few others
but that's is that new that there would be so many humorists who were sort of
proTrump i guess comic Dave Smith has made a turn he's not Oh yeah shane
Gillis um I guess he's not proTrump he's asking for Trump's uh impeachment over
over the Israel stuff I guess but anyway so uh I would give my
compliments to all of the people I mentioned for Yeah greg Guffeld um because they
all made themselves relevant and they didn't do it by having terrible opinions
the van yeah he's more in the gray area but yes so you know Theo is not in the
category of a person who is trying to make serious um
geopolitical comments that change the world but a number of us do we're we're literally
trying to you know make sure the country is steering in the right direction as best we can um so I'm very impressed at
all the people who just carve down a space for themselves by being useful and
having an opinion that people could either debate with or uh agree with so
very impressed um let's see what else
um according to Axios and some reporting by Barack Ravid uh Netanyahu has well
this is Axios's take on it effectively endorsed the idea of regime change in Iran in a string of media appearances
um but Trump they say has remained unconvinced
but do we really know what Trump is convinced of or not we don't do we we
you know it might be that Trump is going to act unconvinced while at the same time stepping aside
and letting Israel do whatever it needs to do um
all right and I guess it was a Israeli air strike
in Iran overnight that uh took out some Iranian military
top top base um I can't imagine that
there would be any humans in the uh Iranian military who would be
going to work in the office wouldn't wouldn't all of the military um
structures be empty by now because they're such obvious targets now the
other thing I wonder about is I assume that u Israel got on top of
Iran's communication devices meaning that
uh meaning that the Iranians probably don't have a secure means of
communicating even if they wanted to um which would tell me that the Israelis
know where everybody is all the time and they know what they're up to all the time so
um I would get out of Tran if I were if I were in the military i would run
because it looks like it's just sending ducks at this point
well in related news um speaking of immigration
uh one of the questions people had is you know why are all the protesters over 65
and um I had speculated is because they're easier to scare you and
especially if they're watching the mainstream media so elderly people make
up a lot of the protesters on the streets for the gokings and the anti- ICE protests
but part of it is because they have a lot of time on their hands part of it is because they're exhippies
so they're reliving their you know their exciting youth being protesters some of
it is maybe because the elderly are on fixed incomes so they feel more
vulnerable so they feel like there's more they have to protest about
um but I would argue that we should see it as a mental disorder
and that the elderly are just more prone to it you know just like Alzheimer's and
other stuff and uh I saw a a post by Meg Brock who was
asking the question on X um when is Trump derangement syndrome going to be
officially added to the DSM5 to make it an official diagnosis
and I wondered if it was already there cuz I've heard uh lots of reports of therapists who treat it like it's real
uh because it is and they've got a lot of clients who come in and say I've got
some form of TDS or at least they exhibit it
and so I went to Gro to find out is it already in the literature cuz why
wouldn't it be wouldn't you expect that by now Trump derangement syndrome would
be a legitimate diagnosis because I'm pretty sure there are a lot
of individual therapists who consider it a legitimate diagnosis
so I I looked and apparently no and Grock says that there's the reason it's
not you know an official disorder is that there's a lack of clinical basis
there is no peer-reviewed studies uh or psychological research or professional
mental health organizations recognizing it as a diagnosible condition and then
Grock says it lacks defined symptoms diagnostic criteria or empirical
evidence required for a legitimate disorder to which I say well wait a
minute isn't it a lot like addiction if I said to you um you have a drinking
problem knowing that drinking is a legal activity for adults
how would you define it as a problem versus a hobby and the answer is usually
if it interferes with your life so if your drinking has an impact on your life
as in you lose your job you lose your relationships you spend all your money you wake up in a ditch well then you've
got a drinking problem if you had two drinks on the weekend with your friends and then took a Uber
home we would mostly say you're just somebody who has a hobby and you don't have a
problem but don't you think TDS is exactly like that
if somebody simply prefers uh a Democrat over Trump I would say "Oh
well that's just a political preference." But if somebody is crying and shaking and and they feel like he's
going to become a king and he's going to lock people up in prison camps
isn't that interfering with your actual life and happiness and wouldn't that be
super easy to diagnose if you were a therapist so in my opinion we have
everything we need which is uh it's easy to diagnose you know do you have a worry
that Trump is president and that he'll do terrible things do you believe things
that are real or do you believe things that are imaginary
and you don't even need that part you could just you could just say um does it
does it affect your life you know do you wake up in the morning shaking and
crying if the answer is yes then you've got a you know a mental
health disorder I would think so I feel like that really needs to be a
legitimate mental health disorder it would help
uh we'll say so speaking of the Trump coalition
um Trump also has trouble with the immigration um issue because Trump had started out
being you know as hardline as you could possibly be on immigration
and that was keeping his coalition together because they were hardline on
immigration too but then when Trump said "Well maybe not the farm workers and the
the hotel hospitality people because they would be hard to replace." Then he
lost a bunch of his followers who said "What do you mean there's no exceptions
if they're here illegally they got to go." So apparently Trump has um veered
back to yes there will be raids on farms and hospitality places including I
suppose Trump hotels I don't know
but uh you remember the uh food company was it valley foods or somebody where uh
the immigration people basically arrested half of the workforce or some
big percentage and apparently they immediately got lots of job applicants
for from uh Americanborn people so if you were worried that there were no
Americans who would apply for you know jobs if the uh foreignb born people who
are not citizens get shipped or deported um we have one
one uh data point that says that it might not be a problem i would argue
that probably will depend a lot on where you are so if you're living out what
state was that was it Iowa or something i can't remember what state it was but
it could be that you know if you're in a rural situation it's easier to fill those jobs maybe i don't know so we'll
we'll see about that but uh Trump has a big problem so he's either going to put
farming and uh and uh the hotel business out of
business or maybe not out of business but deeply inconvenienced
um but as long as there are people who are American citizens who want to apply
for those jobs immediately upon the openings that need to be in pretty good shape so
whether you're in favor of it or not in favor of it it might be practical
so you know take that for what it's worth
according to the uh Postmillennial there's a poll that says a majority of
Hispanic voters support Trump's deportation policies
which we've heard before but it's good that it's consistent uh this is the uh
survey by the League of American Workers and Technometrica Institute of Policy
and Politics 53% of Hispanic voters say they somewhat
or strongly support increasing deportations uh especially ones with criminal records
but that that part's easy so overall six and 10 registered voters
back the Trump um deportation plans so he's still in good shape there
um according to Blaze Media and I guess this comes from the Trump administration
there are 1 million illegal aliens who have reportedly self-deported
now my question would be this is there anything about the group that is
self-epporting that would be uh some kind of a common
theme so my question is would the would the
worst let's say the people who have done more crimes than just coming into the country
illegally uh do you think they would be the ones who would be self- deepporting because they wouldn't want to go to jail
or would it be the ones who want to have the highest odds of coming in legally
because apparently if you self-epport you maintain your ability to come back through a legal process so do you think
the million people who allegedly self-epported
are the the worst people you know the criminal types who are trying to avoid
getting arrested or are they the most law-abiding types who are using a
process that keeps all their options open i don't know but I'm sure most of
you don't care it would be great if it was mostly the
criminals who left but that would be a lot to ask
in other news uh FBI Director Cash Patel is reporting
that the FBI has located documents that detail uh allegations that China
um tried to print a bunch of fake mailin ballots for our 2020 US election now
Just the News has has this story if you want to read up on it john Solomon
But they say that newly declassified intelligence reports partially
corroborate um but but it was recalled before it was fully investigated so we don't have um
confirmation but there's a strongest strong suggestion
that China might might have been involved in trying to rig our elections
and that China allegedly had mass-roduced fake US drivers licenses
as part of their scheme to get the fake mailin ballots and then vote for Joe Biden
now do you think China would have uh cared enough about who was
president that they would think about uh rigging our election
i don't know it feels like something like this would be um too big a risk
because imagine imagine if we caught them that would be pretty big problem for
China so I'm not I would say that the odds of this um being confirmed at some
point are less than 50%
so maybe it's true you know and we kind of want to believe it's true but I'm
going to say that probably the reason it was only partially corroborated and it was dropped is that maybe there wasn't
enough it just wasn't credible enough but we'll see we'll see i could be wrong
um but it doesn't feel like the the type of thing that China would do because it
would be too easy to detect their presence like that the risk of getting caught would be beyond whatever the the
benefit would be so I don't know i'm not I'm not buying this one entirely
well as you know the uh Fed has been holding tight on interest rates when a
lot of people want them to be cut uh the Wall Street Journal says that the reason
that uh the Fed is not cutting rates is that they're still waiting on
combination of inflation numbers and job numbers and they want to see how the
tariffs play out in terms of the public's expectation that the tariffs
will increase prices that would be part of inflation so according to the Wall
Street Journal the only thing keeping the Fed um from
lowering interest rates is the uncertainty around jobs and inflation
and tariffs maybe that that could be the entire answer but
um if you if you like the all-in pod and you follow Chamath who uh I believe
should be known only by his first name you know like uh Madonna or Sher um but
Chimath said uh he thinks that the only reason is political
and he could be right about that too because there's always a reason you know
you could always say well you know that inflation number well those tariffs oh
well we don't know about the jobs number so you could always make up a reason for
why you're either moving the rates or not moving them but it does feel
political doesn't it it does feel like uh Powell is not the biggest fan of
Trump and there's a lot at there's a lot at uh at risk
as Chimath points out um just the savings in um in interest that we pay on
our debt could be like $300 billion a year with just a interest rate change so
it's really big it could be the difference between you know the United States stays a viable country and it
doesn't so we'll see um
apparently Open AI just got a big old contract with the government a $200
million US defense contract now uh Mike Ben points out in a post on
X uh that uh he goes "And now you know
why OpenAI recruited the head of the NSA to its board last year the biggest money
in quote private business is always in losing the Pentagon's infinite taxpayer
money glitch." So the uh the implication
is that uh open AI is uh let's say cooperating with the government and the
government is cooperating back now remember how uh we heard that the CIA
had said that they were only going to allow a few big AI companies to succeed
and that would be easier to control and manage and obviously open AI would be at
the top of the list of ones that our government wants to succeed so do you
think it's a total accident that they get a gigantic government contract
well they might be the most capable of fulfilling the contract because it is
open AI after all so they're sort of a a leader in the field but uh this is one
of those things where you have to you kind of scratch your head and you say "Huh is this all connected
or is it just that open AI has the best AI?" And the government looked at all of them and said "Oh this is the best one
we will never know we'll never know." Um in other news Randy Weingarden who is
the head of the biggest uh teachers union um announced that she's quitting the DNC the Democratic National
Committee now as Corey D'Angelos asks on an expost
why didn't the media ever mention there Randy Weingarten had a position at the Democratic National Committee
and more to the point if Corey D'Angelus didn't know that Randy Weingarden was on
the Democrat National Committee who would i mean he's he's about as
plugged into the whole uh you know school choice teachers union situation
as anybody could be he didn't know so it makes me uh wonder was Randy Weingarten
mostly a Democrat who was also the head of the teachers union or was she on the
teachers union and also a Democrat h it does seem to me that the head of
the teachers union should probably not be on the Democratic National Committee
but uh I guess she she had a reason to leave so it doesn't matter now
it it's kind of a bother that we didn't know it though doesn't it bother you that we didn't know that
that was pretty important to know and uh we didn't
um according to uh the postmillennial the
OMG group O'Keefe Media Group uh has determined that uh some of the
protesters for the No Kings protest were being paid
uh by some communist group they were being paid to protest but they were paid 20 bucks
$20 so here's the problem with a communist plot the communists don't have enough
money to to buy anything good they're like "Hey how would you like to spend
the entire day out in the sun protesting something that doesn't even exist kings
uh a totally imaginary problem and we'll give you $20."
How many of you would protest all day in the sun for $20
i feel like the communists have have a little bit of a you know a little bit of
a model problem there i don't know what it would take but I'm
thinking $200 you know might get somebody to walk
around in the sun for an afternoon but $20
what What would you do for $20 not much
anyway communists do not pay competitive fees
well the uh the publication Nature that's a science publication
um is going to now require that the peer-reviewed papers
um show not just that they're peer-reviewed but that uh show the communication back and forth between the
peer reviewer and the submitter so that feels like a good upgrade so you
could see just how close they were you know what changes they had to make to get uh published i don't know if that's
the answer but at the moment something like 50% of all peer-reviewed papers
turn out to be not reproducible as in not really science um so if they can if
they can improve on the coin flip nature of it which is what it is now then it's
worth a try so I don't know if this will work but definitely worth a worth a shot
all right in other news Texas is apparently going to invest $50 million
in a psychedelic drug research to treat addiction medical Express has this story
and uh I guess Greg Abbott Governor Abbott is all all in on this
and the uh specific psychedelic is something called Ibo gain ibo gain i
don't know much about that but apparently it causes powerful hallucinations that can last for hours
and there are some studies that suggest it might help people stop using opioids
or other drugs even after just one session
one session all right now how many times have I told you a story that had to do
with psychedelics um improving either your mental status
of depression or anxiety or addiction
um it's very very consistent it doesn't seem to matter too much which
hallucinogen you're using there's something about hallucinogens
that uh just improve your brain process and I would argue that I've said this
before but I haven't said it in a while those people who have experienced
hallucinogens at least once I believe they can recognize other people who also
have how many of you would agree with that now you can only agree with that if
you've yourself experienced hallucinations but I believe you can just tell in about
10 seconds you know of interaction with another person that you can tell if
they've ever had a hallucinogen and look in the comments you'll see a lot of people saying "Oh yeah you can
tell." Because I think one experience
changes you forever and I also think and and I have no backing for this whatsoever that you can
tell by the eyes i think you can look in somebody's eyes and you can tell if they've had that
experience and if they're at operating at that level of awareness
now not every time of course but I'll bet you more than guessing i'll bet you could tell
all right ladies and gentlemen that's what I had for you today uh thanks for
joining we'll see if my predictions about uh what's going to happen in Thran
are correct uh I remind you that I'm not backing Israel or not backing them i'm
observing and predicting and uh you know my country is America so
that's the one I care about um I'm going to say a few words privately to the uh people on locals and
the rest of you i will see you tomorrow same time same place i hope hope you
enjoyed it all right locals coming at you in 30 seconds
