oh yeah a lot of stuff Let's uh look at our stocks They
look to be up And the locals people going to have a
special comment section right here Here you go
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's called Coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a better time But if you'd like to take
that experience up to levels that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that
is a cup or a mug or a glass a tank or cherine a canteen jug or flask or vessel
of any kind Fill it with your favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure the dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything better It's called the simultaneous sip
And it happens now
Go Good stuff Well I don't know if you heard but
uh Elon Musk and uh President Trump are having some
difficulty You you probably read a million takes so it's time for mine The only one
that matters Number one did you not think it would be
impossible for Elon Musk to find a way to make his dealerships safe from all
the domestic terrorists Well he
did That the last thing that would be attacked by a Democrat today would be a
Tesla dealership So suddenly total security with a few
tweets Now I don't think that's why he did it Uh I also don't think that it's
some kind of you know 5D chess I don't think it's some kind of agreement they
made Uh it would be a weird kind of an agreement if they did But uh let me give you my takes on
it First of all I don't believe that there's a phone call scheduled for today
right So at one point we heard that uh Trump and Musk would be talking but at
the moment it looks like that's not going to happen Uh Jonathan Carl was
reporting that Um but here's what I liked about the situation Number one I
was kind of proud of the way Republicans especially you know the the big pundits
the way they were handling this So instead of taking sides people were just sort of
expressing some kind of affection You know they they like both They the most
common comment was that it was like watching your parents fight Now that's a
pretty good compliment And you know we've talked before how Democrats
um they're a different animal And Republicans are more forgiving
about you know any any bad thing that happened in particular You know if you
still like the the person in general you're still good with them So I think
that's part of it too So the the fact that Republicans didn't want to throw
either of them over the over the edge I like I like the fact that we can simply
wish they weren't fighting and not have bad feelings about either one of them
especially But a lot of people pointed out that when uh Musk complained about well not
complained but accused uh Trump of having an Epstein connection you know
more so than what we already know uh that that was too far How many of you
thought that That maybe the other stuff was fair you know if he criticizes a
bill or he he criticized something in the bill but not not that seemed too far
right Well the first thing you have to know is that he started out by criticizing just the
bill And did that help Does anybody remember the bill being rewritten
because Elon criticized it I don't Now what would you do if you're Elon Musk
and you haven't gotten the attention you need which by the way I remind you
attention is the first step in persuasion And when he was when he was
simply saying "Hey this doesn't cut the budget enough." No attention I mean a
little bit but it didn't change anything So he went to a level of
risk and controversy that you and I probably would never have gone
to How much of that is the secret of his success Because when you talk about uh
Musk you you tend to talk about how smart he is But the other things that make him
successful is that he's not willing to take no for an answer He he doesn't
recognize you know game over Um he's willing to sleep on the floor and he's
willing to take enormous risks to get something that he believes in is you
know a solution to an existential uh problem So here's what I
think my my armchair psychologist says that uh he might be
bipolar Now he's he said that himself So in some interview I checked on Grock Um
someone asked him if he's bipolar and to me it seems like he's
obviously bipolar and there's a manic phase that comes with that Now the manic
phase can make you unbelievably productive I know because I have it So
when I hit my manic phases oh my goodness do I get a lot done but there
is a little negativity that comes with it And the negative and maybe you've
noticed this if you've been watching me for a while the negativity is that you increase your
tolerance to risk to a level that other people can't
understand So how often has that helped him solve some gigantic problem or you
know fight through some wall just because he was manic and nothing was
going to stop him It feels like this might have be one of those situations Now some people are
saying you know he might be on some kind of stimulants or something but uh I don't know anything about that I don't
see any uh direct evidence of that But if so it might be accelerating what
would be a normal you know manic episode cuz the the Epstein island thing that's
got um excess risk written all over it
It just isn't something that you and I would have done in our normal state of mind But I don't think he would either I
I think if he were not having sort of a a manic episode and I'm just guessing by
the way I'm I'm not some expert but to me it looks like he he took his risk
profile and he just ramped it up until he could break through Did he break
through Are we talking about the budget uh more seriously than we were before
Yes we are So when I say somebody's manic that
doesn't mean they're doing the wrong stuff When I say they're at a higher risk profile than you or I would be in
that same situation that doesn't mean it's a mistake That could be why he's
the richest man in the world and you're not because he's willing to say "What is this take?" And then his body just goes
"Boom I'm going to give it to you." and uh he he definitely seemed risk risk
averse you know during the little tiff Now today I saw a uh a message that
sounded like maybe had cooled off a little bit Maybe
um Trump apparently is not treating it like it's his biggest problem or his
biggest issue he has to deal with which is exactly right One of the things we
like about Trump is that uh I hate to say transactional because everybody says
that but kind of fits So if tomorrow uh Musk turned out to be exactly the
person that Trump needed to get something done then they would be friends again and all would be forgotten
So we kind of like that about Trump is a good role model that way that you don't have to throw out the entire person if
there's you know something about the person that you like So my one of my favorite parts was
uh if you haven't done this yet you should watch watch the Democrat um
pundit reaction to them getting what they think they wanted Now what they
think they wanted was a rift between Musk and
Trump Well what would happen if they get it Well they got it But the funny part
is looking at their faces Um and and I'm going to come up with a uh a phrase that
I think I made up I call it a rat smile So here would be a regular smile
Hi I'm smiling regular If you're listening on audio this just imagine a
regular smile But then there's the the smile where the eyes are too
closed and you look a little like a rat So the Democrats are giving all
these rat smiles and it's kind of hilarious because they think they're
getting what they want but really they're just observing They're not
getting anything So the the only thing they got is that
the biggest target they had against Trump just went away Their target went away You know
that even though Trump was super uh popular um Elon Musk they did a good job
of saying "Oh you're just doing it for your your business interests." And so
they had something they could attack And now well now that Trump said it Trump
actually suggested that maybe Elon wasn't that bad until the EV credits
went away Uh which I think may may have been part of what triggered uh Musk to
take it to the next level I don't know for sure but
uh what uh what Musk has done is he has satisfied the first rule of persuasion
uh and he's got your attention and it's attention not about Epstein You'll
forget about that eventually Trump Trump just brushed it off because it's it's not based on any information or anything
He's just he was just um causing trouble
So here's what I would like to see I would like to see Stephen Miller and
Elon Musk sitting in the same room and talking about this bill Stephen Miller
um is if if you're a you know proTrump person you would probably agree with
this Stephen Miller is one of the most capable
wellspoken smart you know MAGA
people maybe of all time right He's just one of the smartest people But he keeps
telling us that this is not a spending bill Okay I get it I get it that
technically it's not a spending bill but really are you telling me that
the bill that determines how much you spend is not a spending
bill Now that's
not big words They try to weasle you or they try to fool you into thinking one
thing is another It's a big bill with lots of spending that can be adjusted by
Congress and some people think it should be less So for Stephen Miller to say
publicly you that we have to understand it's not a spending bill and the idea is
that future future bills would be the place that spending is cut is so
disingenuous sounding now and maybe maybe it's the best our community has You know maybe um
it's too late to change it so he's just trying to try to get to the next phase
with another bill maybe but
uh it does seem to me that uh the other bills are going to
be impossible to cut in costs Now I'm no expert on the uh
government budget process but is it not true Let's see who said this first I
think it was uh Pablus Pablus where are you
We'll get to it But I'm not sure the other bills can even be uh cut unless
you have 60% vote in the Senate And since we know
we can't get 60 votes it doesn't look to me like the the cuts are ahead does it
So um somebody's asking about Elon's black
eye Who knows I mean I I I think the correct opinion on his black eye is that
he's got a toddler That seems like a perfectly you know good explanation No reason to believe
anything else Yeah So Cynical Pablus has a quote I'm going to get to but he asked
uh Cynical Pablus asked on X uh can somebody explain how you get to the
point where you could actually cut something given that it would take 60 votes and that will never happen So
correct me if I'm wrong We have Stephen Miller telling us that the current bill
is quote not a spending bill but when we get to the ones that
are spending bills there is no chance in hell that we could cut it Is that
true That that's my current understanding So imagine being Elon
Musk You've been asked to sacrifice so much and you did to come up with a bunch
of Doge cuts and a bunch of Doge processes and you do all that work and
then it looks to you like nothing serious got cut Can you
even imagine how you would feel about that Well I'd be I'd be flipping out And
if uh and if my mere complaining wasn't
enough depending on where I was in my manic phase I might go just absolutely
freaking nuts on whoever put me in that position And that looks like the
president So can they ever uh work together and get past it Yeah It doesn't
mean they will but yes there's nothing that would stop them from you know figuring it out um if they want to So
I'm not super concerned about uh that conversation Um you know I think
yesterday Elon threatened he would decommission the Dragon rocket and Trump
was saying they should save money by cutting all the contracts to Elon None of that should be taken seriously
Um I wouldn't worry about any of it But let me tell you what I think it is not
It is definitely not 4D chess It is definitely not something
that Musk and Trump came up together with and said "All right you say this
and I'll say this." No it was definitely wasn't that
Um and then uh Mike Ben said a video today
uh in which he reminds us how important uh Elon Musk was to Trump's
success which adds a little fuel to this because if you think my god you know
you're only president because I you know deliver free speech back to the country
in the form of X which is true Um I if I'm a top financial backer and I if uh
if Musk is the reason that the other tech bros felt safe to back Trump and I
I think that is part of it then uh Musk probably
was important enough that you could argue that Trump would not have been elected We it might have even been hard
to hear from him without X But let's check on some other people
uh like Ran Paul So Ran Paul is talking about this uh latest bill He says "We've now
increased spending at the get-go more than all of Doge
cuts." He said "I think Elon Musk did an amazing job and we're dwarfing it with
new spending." And then he goes this is Rand Paul He says "This has always been
a bill that was hijacked and conceived of by Lindsey Graham to explode the
military caps." Well I don't know about that Um do you think Lindsey Graham was
trying to cleverly explode the military gaps and that's what this is all about
Maybe I mean I wouldn't rule it out but I wouldn't I wouldn't have a an instinct
on that either way But related to that there's a CIA officer
uh darn I didn't write down what podcast this was on but on a podcast recently
said that u and I don't know that this can be proven but the CIA officer says
that bank account records would show that Lindsey Graham is laundering money from the Ukraine war back into his
personal bank accounts Now I have not seen any evidence of
that and uh it doesn't surprise me when there's some ex CIA guy saying stuff
that sounds sketchy So I don't know if you can believe that exactly but it's
out there So some of the mystery may have to do with Lindsey Graham and
wanting to get money for Ukraine at least Ukraine
Mario Noel um did a post on X in which he described
the fall of Rome as basically our exact current
situation that we uh overextended which is what Rome did uh
had too much military need compared to other things and uh apparently Rome just had
massive inflation And they they took their little silver coins and you know they they reduced the
amount of silver in it and they kept doing it until there was basically no silver and then they were broke and then
they went out of business Rome did Some would say it didn't go out of business
Some would say it's the Vatican I guess But um I was starting to think that every
major power um unless they were killed by an
army were destroyed by their own spending because you reach some point
where nobody can say no and there just too many people who are on the
take So we're kind of there
How much would you want to see Steven Miller and uh Elon Musk in one room with
nobody else and just turn the camera on and say "All right you guys talk about
the spending bill and why the Doge cuts don't seem to be enough or why they're
not there." and uh just see them see them work it out cuz I would love to
know u if there's any middle ground there and
I don't think that Musk talking to Trump about the details of the bill That
doesn't seem like the right right approach because Musk would be in the
details and Steven Miller is in the details but Trump you know he he knows
the big picture of course So that's what I want to see I want to see Steven
Miller and Musk talk it out while we watch
Representative uh Thomas Massie um who's one of the few people maybe the
only one who reads these gigantic bills He found uh in in the bill there's a
provision banning state and local governments from regulating AI
Now he points out that that would cause um that that would cause
uh states to have to accept a gigantic you know data center maybe where they
didn't want it but uh I feel like this might be
necessary in other words if AI is really the difference between you know the
country surviving and not surviving then probably we need the federal
government to remove as many restrictions as possible and allow our
biggest companies to build whatever they need as fast as they can
So although Massie is he's obviously uh
um he represents his local constituents and he's doing a good job of it I
suspect the larger military need for AI is probably a bigger priority So yes it
will be bad for some local people who don't want that data center to be built near their
house but it's also good to keep the country safe
So all right so uh here's a cynical
Pablus He says uh uh how is it possible to achieve the
bill Elon Musk Thomas Massie and Ran Paul want without 60 votes in the Senate
and he kind of challenges people to come up with it and I saw the comments and
nobody could So we've got this weird sleepwalking toward disaster thing going
on where if you say something like our
current spending will kill us for sure the answer will be "But look how
good the priorities are for what Trump ran on." And then you say "Okay did you hear
anything I just said Our current spending will kill us
all for sure Yeah but did you see how how magna
perfect all these things are Okay you're not hearing anything The
current spending will kill us all for
sure I don't know I I I think you're ignoring how good this bill is for all
the things that Trump ran on No the current spending will kill us
all and then repeat it It's like one side isn't even
talking right Are you having the same experience that that one side is just
ignoring the existential threat which is
guaranteed It's not it's not even a risk If it were just a risk then I'd say well
I guess we're taking risk No we're walking directly toward a gigantic hole
in the ground and there's absolutely nothing that looks like it would stop us from falling in That I think that's
where Musk is It's where I am as well So anyway
um so saw a clip Yes this morning actually I saw a clip where Trump says
that we have a deal with China cuz he had a phone call with President
Xi and for some reason he doesn't seem to
be able to clarify whether that deal was an entire trade deal with China or
something smaller about rare earth magnets And then I thought well
obviously you know this is the biggest story in the country I mean it's bigger than the Must thing
So obviously it'll be just all over X if there's a giant trade deal with
China I can't tell Do any of you
know I'm assuming that it's not a comprehensive trade deal
Um because that would be surprising There are too many too many elements in play But it's just rare earth right Do
any of you know you I could have uh maybe check
rock before I got on Um somebody says that Trump is asking
must to join him tonight to work it out on the ninth green I don't know about
that Anyway so stock market is up which
could be just a a bounce response because the Elon thing looked like a big
deal but really isn't a big deal So I'm just
looking [Music] Um they're trading state visits I know
that But none of you know right None of you know whether there's a
comprehensive trade deal which would be the biggest thing in the world versus
only rare earth I don't know why Trump would be so vague about that So I'm going to guess
it's only a deal about rare earth because the other would seem like a bigger
deal All right Well according to Breitbart the US trade deficit has
narrowed by record amount I guess there were a lot of exports right after Liberation Day Now I wouldn't expect
that trend to continue Um I think that might have
something to do with what happened because of Liberation Day and the tariffs and the uncertainty
and all that But maybe maybe Maybe our
maybe Trump found a way to narrow our uh trade deficit We'll see Keep an eye on
that Meanwhile uh just the news Ben Weeden is reporting that the uh Trump
tariffs uh are going to slash the deficit by $2.8 trillion over 10 years
according to the CBO How many of you believe that
How many of you believe that the uh Trump tariffs will slash the deficit by
2.8 trillion over 10 years I'm going to say
no Everything over 10 years is Yeah 10 years Uh in 10 years we'll find
ways to change so many things that that this estimate will make no sense
Um but that's better than raising the uh
raising the uh deficit So maybe don't know Um according to the Gateway Pundit
Representative Comr is uh sub he's going to subpoena the Biden White House
physician Have any of you seen a picture of Joe Biden standing with his uh White House
physician And the White House physician has a dumb and dumber
haircut and he looks like a character literally from the movie Dumb and Dumber
And and then Biden himself looks you know kind of dumb in the picture And I
thought to myself how in the world can you pick a doctor who looks like he came
out of the movie Dumb and Dumber Like how do you do that Anyway that's my only
comment about that Maybe he'll tell us something we need to hear Meanwhile
according to the daily skeptic if you want some good news uh the global
greening in other words how uh how much vegetation is growing on the earth uh
thanks to higher CO2 is striking new heights So you don't hear about that as
much do you So the world is getting way greener and that has to do with CO2 uh
most of you knew that was going to happen But the other things the Daily Skeptic this is uh Chris Morrison's
writing uh things that are also not mentioned so much anymore is that the
Arctic the Arctic sea level uh has uh not been shrinking since
2007 which would be counter to climate change predictions
And the uh the Gulf Stream has not reduced which would be counter to
climate change predictions And there's been a record growth in the Great Barrier Reef for the
last three years which is very counter to the climate change predictions
So if I haven't told you this recently wait till you find out about
climate models
Um in other news the Washington Examiner is writing about how uh you remember uh
Ibram Kendi he was the uh author and
activist who was an anti-racist and he got funding after the
George Floyd stuff He got funding to create an anti-racist research center
So now that a number of years have gone by how do you think the anti-racist
research center is doing Well you would not be surprised
that they're closing down because they didn't get anything done
uh Washington Examiner Review of Public Records found that anti-racism centers
at five major universities uh got generous support after the 2020
George Floyd stuff And uh looks like none of them have achieved really
anything of value so they're all just closing down
Surprise You never could guess Uh according to neuroscience news
uh they can make AI be funny especially with
memes but they can't make AI as funny as the best human can be funny So AI can be
funnier than some human who's not very funny but the best funny human is still
substantially better than AI And uh as I've predicted that will stay
that way as long as AI is these large language model things Maybe when maybe
when we get some entirely new kind of AI it'll be different but at the moment
um humans have the advantage So I still have a purpose
Let's check in with the uh Pacific Palisades where there was a big fire in Southern California earlier this year
And apparently nearly 300 uh residents have decided to sell their
properties rather than rebuild and uh only a hundred have begun
reconstruction Now why would so many people sell the most valuable real
estate you can imagine after it gets cleaned up uh rather than stay there and
build when they're so lucky to have such amazing real estate The answer is it's
California So as a gateway pundit points out um just just the fact that getting
anything done in California is a nightmare Uh a lot of people said just give me my money and let me get out of
here So at the same time uh California Democrats have issued a dance video in
which they several of them are dancing to Usher Why did they create a dance video
of cringy middle-aged people who need to go to the gym I don't
know Maybe because they thought they couldn't think of anything useful to do for the country So they're like "I've
got an idea A dance video showing that white people have no uh have no no dance
moves whatsoever It was very cringy You're
going to have to see it." Um over at UC Berkeley as you know the
president of uh the United States is giving some pressure on the funding to
various uh entities that are not doing enough to uh battle anti-semitism and
DEI And so the University of California's staff members are going to do a uh
firstofits-kind lawsuit uh a class action lawsuit against Trump
for their research funding cuts and they think that they hope that
this will become a model so that others can use it to get their funding back as
well So obviously the funding is for very important stuff otherwise you know
they wouldn't be fighting so hard for it Let's see Um here's one example Uh one
of the lead plaintiffs is a history professor named uh Christine Filio
Um and uh I guess her funding was cut by a4 million dollars and uh the funding would have
gone to a study uh to study Greek Orthodox Christians in
the 19th century Turkey
So those of you who are depending on the results of a
study of 19th century Greek Orthodox
Christians in Turkey well you're going to be very disappointed because it looks like that
funding has been cut Um but also that's not the only thing
that got cut I mean it's not all like worthless sounding stuff like that
Here's one Um the director of the clim project climate at UC Berkeley Law
Initiative uh what they wanted to study but it got cut is they wanted to study using drones
and robots to find cheaper ways to monitor methane emissions from
landfills which is a major contributor to climate change
So um did we really need drones and robots
to measure methane from landfills Because I thought we had all
these climate models that were so well tuned that could tell you what the temperature will
be in 80 years And you're telling me now that I needed a robot and a drone to get accurate
enough information to know if the temperature goes up in 80 80 years Um I'm going to say that probably
we don't need that but got cut In other news interesting engineering is
reporting that uh Amazon is building an indoor I guess a gigantic
uh test place for robots It'll be in San Francisco and it will be a humanoid park
So humanoid is because the robots are human form and it's like a custom indoor
obstacle course to get the robots ready for delivering packages for
Amazon Um but to me it sounds like a playground for robots
How how much how much training would you have to give a robot until it knew how to deliver a
package to every kind of different doorway and steps and every every kind
of weird situation and and then of course they're going to get robbed right
What happens if the robot has a package and a a bad person runs up with a mask
on and just grabs the package out of the hands of the robot Is the robot trained
to do what I mean it's not going to fight them So there are a lot of questions
about these humanoid robots I don't know I feel like there's
some better solution than humanoid robots but maybe not Uh meanwhile according to the Wall
Street Journal Iran has ordered thousands of tons of ballistic missile ingredients from China
Great So that should go well Uh thousands of tons of ballistic missile
ingredients So it doesn't sound like Iran is giving up anytime soon
And in other news related the Washington Times Bill Girtz is writing that uh
China has long held a military doctrine I guess you might call it in which
they're trying to affect the brains of the other side So there a whole bunch of different
ways they can do it But um the thinking is that the old way of war where you
would send you know hordes of people in one direction and they would all get mowed down or stuck with swords doesn't
work so much anymore So they're going for various cognitive
weapons and uh makes me wonder would you even know if somebody hit you with a
cognitive weapon Because some of them just make you angry or they hurt your
morale I don't know So cognitive weapons it's coming
And according to Politico China is helping Russia pull ahead in lethal
drone uh race with Ukraine How many drones do
you think Well according to Politico Veronica Mila Zerova
um Ukraine managed to uh make let's see
uh up to a million tactical drones in the first years of the war
And they're aiming to produce 2.5 million tactical drones and 30,000 long
range strike drones just 2025 2.5 million drones Now I guess most
of the good drones are the ones that uh can't be jammed because they they they
run on these enormously long fiber optic cables which doesn't even seem like it
would work I can't believe that they're really drones that are attached to a
cable It It doesn't seem like that could work but it does
And meanwhile um let's see And then the Russia drone producers I don't know if
how we know this um can make up to 15 Oh
no Uh uh this is long range ones Oh they'll make more than 30,000 And
they'll make up to 2 million small tactical drones
So what happens when there are so many drones that all the humans are killed
the moment they walk outdoors Cuz we're sort of there Um
apparently the Ukrainian soldiers um if they're on the front line they can
never go outside because they can't see the drones and the drones are pretty
good at picking off anybody who walks outside So apparently there's a mental health problem on top of being on the
front lines of you of the Ukrainian war which sounds like a mental health problem by itself Uh that you can never
leave your little enclosure because the minute you walk outside they just kill
you And I think that works both ways by the way I think I think the Russians can't walk outside at all So what
happens if if you add like another million drones to that
2025 or maybe 2026 is going to be lit The entire sky over Ukraine and Russia
are just going to be solid drones So it seems like their little
cables would get mixed up Well according to Breitbart News Oliver
Lane is writing that uh Trump is going to threaten both Russia and Ukraine with
sanctions uh if either of them don't get serious about making peace To which I say there
can't be any sanctions left Are are you telling me that there are sanctions left
that have not been used that are so good it would make them seek peace for the
first time I don't believe that I'm going to have to hear some
examples of what those sanctions would be I don't believe that at all And even
if they sound good on paper it's got to be the kind that are easy to thwart So
it's going to be something like uh we're going to sanction the people who buy oil
from uh Russia and then we'll find out that 80% of the oil is bought by China
and we don't want to sanction them because you know they'll sanction us and blah blah blah So I don't think we have
anything My my best guess is we have no leverage whatsoever for uh at least on
Russia anyway So that's my take for
today I think your uh Elon and Trump situation will work itself out Um if
what it does is it gets us serious about cutting the uh deficit where we have not been
serious before then I would say that's a step forward But uh at least we're
talking about it with a little more seriousness than we had before So I'm
going to take the win on that Uh not for me but for the country And that's all I
got for you today So everybody else I'll see you tomorrow But if you're on locals
I'm going to say goodbye to them privately in 30 seconds All right locals
