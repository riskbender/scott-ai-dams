well there you are It's good to see you Happy Sunday and uh happy birthday to me I
will stipulate that you all love me like
crazy As much as I love you back All right let's take care of
that We've done all our happy birthdays Let me get my comments
on It's kind of a non-eventful birthday I would say relatively
speaking I mean it's not like throwing events but you know what I
mean So last night was my
stepdaughter's wedding uh reception which was just a big party at
the house And oh my god that was a lot of action for somebody like
me Way way too much stimulation but they all had a great
time We'll see if I can stay awake There was only about two hours between the end
of the party and me waking up to do this So my stepdaughter was still up from the
night before when I got up to do the show So that tells you how much fun they
had All right good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time But if you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a copper and mug or a glass a tanker shellstein a canteen
jugger flask a vessel of any kind and fill it with your favorite liquid I like
coffee And join me now for the unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything
better It's called the simultaneous sip and it's going to happen now
Go Oh Paul thank you I won't say thank you every time but
I do appreciate it every time I think you ought to know All right it's uh
summer Can we call it summer yeah let's call it summer So let's see what kind of stories
the uh the news is serving up in the summer Now if you don't follow the news
you wouldn't know that all the A+ players take the summer off or at least
they're gone for a you know big part of the summer So the uh the stories that you
get in the middle of the summer uh are less exciting than the ones you
would get normally Let let me give you an example Uh in Politico there's a headline and a
story that goes with it that Trump and Musk aids have spoken amid pause and
hostilities It's not even about Musk and Trump It's about their aids have spoken
Don't you think they both have about a thousand people in their circle and and the overlap is probably like 500 people
of course their aids have spoken Of course they have What kind of
story is that it it has nothing to do with Musk or Trump or any decisions that
they've made That's what you call a summer story
It looks like a story but it's not really Not really All right here's
another one According to The Hill there the Atlantic has a
seaw seaweed blob uh that's going to break records and
it's going to get even bigger than it is now It's already breaking records So it's a seaweed blob
So I think there's something that happens in the summer that happens less
in the rest of the year which is we get attacked by blobs It's not the same blob every time
Like it could be a hurricane blob It could be a UFO blob could be a meteor
heading toward the the planet but there's always some blob that's coming after
us And then we worry about it for a while and then we move on to the next
blob I guess All right here's another summer story Uh a reporter asked
Trump "Uh are you worried that Russia Ukraine could spiral into a nuclear
conflict?" What kind of question is that and he says Trump says uh uh I don't uh
I hope not I hope not So in case you were wondering Trump hopes there's not a
nuclear war That doesn't have to happen So that's your summer news In
case you were wondering you might have been wondering I wonder what Trump thinks of nuclear war Well now you have
your summer news answer He's opposed to it Doesn't like nuclear war
Surprise All right In other news there's something called an ice battery
uh which would power a bunch of homes according to interesting engineering
Now when I say an ice battery it does not hold electricity It literally just
makes ice and then that ice uh so it makes the ice at night when the
electricity is cheap and then it uses the ice during the day to uh cool your
cool your home if you have AC So it's a sort of idea where I said
to myself we didn't have that before No Nobody until now nobody thought about
using cheap electricity to make blobs of ice that would cool the building Yeah
it's weird All right Well it's we have it now All right ABC has a story
um that I call orphan persuasion I want you to see if this was
a real news story or it's obviously propaganda against Trump All right Real
or propaganda all right So the story is uh according to ABC News the Trump
administration's cuts to foreign aid have resulted in children in Ugandan
orphanages losing access to medication according to local
workers Now is that a real story well it might be
real but what's left out do we have some kind of special uh
obligation to Ugandan orphans because it seems to me if you
looked all over the world you would find suffering people that were doing even
worse than the or the Ugandan orphans Do we owe all of them
medication you know you can't even you cannot evaluate whether this is a
horrible thing or a good thing unless you know the context Is it uh did they cut
1% from their total charity budget i don't know All All I know from ABC is
these poor Ugandan orphans are not going to get their
medication Now that ladies and gentlemen is pure
propaganda because did they really need to find an orphanage really they they couldn't find
people who were just sort of suffering because the aid had been cut They have to find a Ugandan
orphanage Now I feel sorry for the orphanage if they lost something that they need But we kind of need to know is
the US supposed to pay for everybody's medication
everywhere at what point can we draw the line and say "It's a cruel tough world
but we can't buy everybody's medication." I don't know
Well Trump has warned Musk allegedly that there will be serious consequences
if he funds Democratic candidates according to just the news
Now that's something that Musk has threatened I think at the
moment that's probably off although he might target some specific people for
specific things I suppose that's possible but at the moment it's
off So I don't think that's uh going to be a thing All right Um you want to have some
fun i'm going I'm going to give you a question that you can use at your next
family or barbecue get together It's going to be the most provocative
messed up question but it will sound completely innocent All right The question would be
this Hypothetically could Elon Musk and his
tech bros rig an American election for their own benefit as oligarchs and not
be and not be caught just think about that question
Imagine asking that question of your most Democrat friend who hates Elon Musk
and you say "Do you think he and his tech geniuses could uh throw an
election?" Because if they say no then shut
up If he doesn't have any impact on elections you may maybe you should just
leave him alone But if he does and I think most people
would fall into the trap and they'd say "Oh yeah Elon Musk he could use his
satellites and his neurolink boring company and they'd come up with something and say uh yes you know the
Doge people could you know play with the voting records." So if you can get them to
admit that Elon Musk and his tech bro
helpers hypothetically could rig an election then how do you know 2020 was
good that's where the fun starts And then people will say but but no court
has found any problems to which I'd say but you think that Elon Musk could rig
an election without leaving trace So there wouldn't be any court finding in
that case either But but but that's where the cognitive dissonance will kick
in If you can get that far uh they will change the subject tell you they have to
go use the restroom or have some kind of weird cognitive dissonance because once
they've admitted that somebody could rig an election if they had the right kind
of technical knowhow and money it kind of opens the door that there's more than
one person who can do it like the CIA for example
Well according to Blaze Media
um does Oh well here's another question related to Musk and rigging election I I
saw some people say that Musk was rigging the 2024 election by adding a
lot of money and most mostly money right
oh but also he has control over Axe We don't know if he made any changes
on Axe but in theory his enemies believe he could have So here's my question
If you believe that somebody's money could change an election and effectively rig
it what about somebody who doesn't bother a lot of money but is really good
with messaging for example uh the difference between a clown genius
and the golden age and common sense those are really strong campaign
messages And then you look at Bernie Oh the
oligarchs Oh the oligarchs And you don't even know what he's talking about So is
it fair that Bernie and his messengers are all just idiots oh the oligarch Got
to watch out for the but the Republicans have somewhat
brilliant messaging help Mostly Trump Trump's the number one messenger and you
know nobody's ever been better But Trump also has really capable message people who
weigh in whenever there's something that's a little bit out of whack and I'm one of them So you know I don't control
anything But if you came out with a new message and I said "Oh that's not
persuasive." Wouldn't you feel a little bit of pressure to maybe you know fix
that probably would So is that is that
rigging an election am I rigging it because I'm better with words and with
persuasion it feels like I am You know in the same way that somebody putting a
lot of money into it would be rigging it I would definitely be rigging it by
better messaging Anyway um Blaze Media is pointing out
that uh there are some recent u polls that show President Trump's approval is
among the best it's ever been So Rasmmanson and Insider Advantage
and Trafalog group are all showing that his numbers are looking really really
good Now who knows what polls are accurate and which ones are rigged and
blah blah blah but uh those are three polls Um I only know a little bit about
one of them so I don't think they made up any numbers
Um here's a little uh tip for you because I used to work in data
collection and data analysis when I had my corporate job
If you can boil down uh whatever your complicated situation is into one
number that's kind of a miracle But it also can activate people because if you
have a complicated story about well this is up and this is down and this might go
sideways but when you put it all together you should do whatever it is I'm asking you to do that's not going to
work because there are too many numbers and it's complicated and there's variables So if you want to persuade
somebody if possible you want to you want to take the message down to you know one number
as long as that number is a you wisely chosen one I'll give you an example
The one number that I care about with all these spending packages and by the way the latest spending package
according to Steven Miller is not a spending package It's just a package in
which they're spending It's so ridiculous that we're
having this conversation cuz the public says if your package is spending money
you're a spending package And yeah we don't care if you if
you use different words within Congress Oh it's a recision It's a this or that
Great You can use your different words internally But if you're spending my
money and there's a bill involved it's a spending bill
Sorry I'm not going to back off from that You know you you're going to have to meet me halfway It's a spending
bill All right But if you have a spending bill in the context of a big
deficit that might kill us all what's the one number that if you could produce it you
would understand exactly what you're getting from the bill you know beyond the details of of what's in there But in
terms of the spending the one number you need is how much does it add to or
subtract from the debt and I'm going to say over three years because the CBO and
the government they like to do the 10year thing The 10-year thing is pure  No nobody can predict anything
over 10 years Three is a stretch It's like a big stretch but at least it's you
know in the realm of of something that makes sense So I want to see one number
I want to see how much does this latest spending package uh add to the deficit
or subtract Now you might say to yourself well Scott that's not very hard Obviously the
CBO or whoever else has has uh scored it so you know it's not like nobody's
looking into it So somebody has that number right and um our press would be
reporting on that number Now would you agree with the fact that you generally
understand that it has a lot of mega Trump things in it that you like and
that part you don't have to argue about too much if you're a Trump supporter But
don't you want to know the impact on the deficit you kind of you kind of need to
know that don't you so let me give you a little uh taste of
why you don't know that And I don't either by the way I have no idea So
it'll uh so it comes as a uh sort of a package
deal All right let me get back to that because I've got a got a piece that fits
into it perfectly So you're looking for the one number
Um and Russ vote according to the Hill Now Russ is
uh he's a budget guy right i don't know his official job but everybody has a
high opinion of Russ's vote and his you know budget work But uh here's what he
said Well here's what the Hill said So this is your press trying to inform you
whether the bill is adding to or subtracting from the deficit And I swear
I'm not making this up I'm going to read the exact words because otherwise you
think you just made that up There's no way that's true Um but here's what it
says According to The Hill President Trump's tariffs will take a major bite
out of US deficit levels Oh okay Well that that's pretty good And Russ vote
also said the same thing So So I'm like okay Russ said it would reduce the
deficit We don't know how much yet Um and the Hill says it will reduce the
deficit So far so good Is there a number yes $2.5 trillion dollars over the next
decade Now I'd like to see that over three years
Um because it's you know less crazy but we're really close We're really close
Now having read that what Russ Vote said and what the Hill said I'm going to read
you the next paragraph that's also in the Hill and the same story You ready for
this um and this is from the CBO The deficit reduction is almost
remember $2.5 trillion deficit reduction It says
the def the deficit reduction is almost exactly the same size as the deficit
addition Wait what what there's a deficit
reduction but there's also a deficit addition Who in the world doesn't net
those two things out and just tell you what the bottom line is so if you didn't read that far you would
not know that the CBO found that the bill would add 2.4 trillion dollars to
deficits through 2034
So does it add to the deficit or does it subtract and how many
of you knew that when you're talking about the deficit there are additions to it and
there are subtractions from it and they track them separately How many of you knew that i
didn't know it This is the most absurd
thing It's absolutely crazy Anyway uh Russ votes also thinks the
tariffs will take a big bite out of the deficit but that's what I think that uh
was calculated in those numbers I gave you So I was asking myself as I was
playing with Grock this morning what is it about the United States that could
ever increase our revenue enough that we could take a bite out of the deficit
and I thought I started with okay insurance you know what if the
government became the you know the insurer of everybody instead of taxes
but then you look at the total amount that the uh country spends on insurance
it's a big number but it's not deficit big so you think oh that's not really
big enough even even if the government took a slice of that business not really big enough to make a
The only thing I know of that's big enough is the energy market So the energy market in the US
uh according to Grock is about uh over
1.55 trillion per year That would include electricity oil natural gas
renewables etc Now I don't have an idea of how to use
the fact that that's a gigantic market to reduce our deficit but there's only
one thing that's gigantic besides the deficit And you're not going to be able
to take care of the deficit with something small You're going to need something
gigantic So I feel like there's some kind of pressure in the world mounting that
uh the energy market if we could somehow really get a hold of that maybe sell it
to other countries who want to run their own AI that if we uh if we got some kind
of government I don't know partnership we might be able to make
just you know ton of money and maybe take it But uh anything short of the energy
market is just not really big enough You know you you could look at cutting
things you know like social services but nobody's going to say yes to that So if
you were going to try some you know clever workound that wasn't about cutting
uh the energy market is the only one Now I wouldn't just tax it cuz that would be
you know bad for business but I'll bet there is some way to monetize it either
the nuclear stuff or geothermal or um
something so that we're you know don't you think we could prop up a government
slash private industry that made a hundred billion a year in in uh energy
profits probably Again that wouldn't be nearly enough but maybe you could grow it from
there Well the Proud Boys have a lawsuit
um related to their uh arrest on January 6 the capital what is called the capital
riot by some people And uh they're claiming a wrongful
prosecution And that's sparking debates of course about uh the fact that they
got pardoned Um I'll bet they have a case without knowing anything about
their case I'll bet they do cuz the Proud Boys are not
idiots So they're not just going to start some lawsuit that's ridiculous
I've got a feeling the Proud Boys might have the last laugh here So we'll see
Rahm Emanuel Democrat Um I was looking at his
messaging skills All right So here's an example Um he was talking to White House
bureau chief Dasha Burns and uh you know I think he was
asked "What should Democrats do differently?" You know what what they're all being asked and he said Democrats
should quote stop talking about bathrooms and locker rooms and start
talking about the classroom All right Is that good do you think that's good
persuasion no it's not good persuasion It's just
sort of a rhy thing It's not going to make you act in any specific different way
Um and this is what I see uh you know Cy Booker and you know a lot of the
Democrats do Um you could probably come up with like 10 different Democrats who
come up with rhymes So they're thinking "All right we're getting our ass kicked on this
policy stuff What should we do?" Well have we tried
rhyming or have we tried being clever with words oh no We don't need the
bathrooms or the locker rooms We need to talk about the classrooms That is so
weak and empty that you can't imagine Trump ever saying it can you have you
ever heard Trump say something as lame as bathrooms and locker rooms but we
should be talking about classrooms he's never said anything that lame in his entire life So what Trump knows is that
what makes these things you know powerful his messaging is if he's
provocative So where Rahm is going for a clever word
play like an LLM you know AI uh Trump goes for the
jugular He doesn't do the he doesn't do the word play He tells me if you don't
do this uh criminals will come across the border and slay your
family Well which one of those are you going to remember oh got to talk Don't
talk about the bathrooms and locker rooms Talk about the classroom versus
uh Trendy Ragua is going to come across the border and slay your entire
family There's no there's no comparison The Democrats don't have the slightest
grasp of persuasion It's like they've never been introduced to it as a skill Whereas
Trump is you know the best of all time Anyway rhyming without policy ideas it's
not going to work And then lastly you're wondering is Rahm Emanuel somebody who
could run for office and win well I mixed
feelings Number one he's smart enough uh
to alter his approach I don't know if he would alter it the way I think he should
but he's definitely smart enough to say "Did that work did that not work?" Change his approach He's he's very smart
and he's experienced but unfortunately he has crime boss
eyes and I don't know that he can fix that Now I'm not saying he's a crime
boss I'm saying his eyes look like he just murdered somebody And how are you
going to how are you going to ignore that you can't really ignore that So the
way I always think of it is if you were a director and you were you were casting
for your movie and you needed a crime boss would Rahm Emanuel look like a
crime boss would be good in your movie yeah it would be And that's not
true of everybody right adam Schiff would not look like he could be a crime
boss You know Swallwell not really Schumer no not really It's it's kind of
unique to Rahm Emanuel that his eyes just say I just
killed somebody and I could kill you next So no I don't know how he gets past
that Well it's my favorite season and by that
I mean fake protest season So has it been every year that these uh
NOS's and fake organizations Soros funds and you know various Democrat rich guys
fund it it's every summer right and they put their muscle on the street and it's
you know some of them are Antifa or Yantifa connected some of them are communist literally communist uh but
they might have names that don't sound too communist And so here are the things you can kind
of expect Number one if you're a Republican and you want to get a jump on
things I would start referring to the Democrat uh protest as
chaos because that's a word that they they think works It does doesn't make
much difference really but I would steal it because they're going to use it as
something that you know maybe the Trump administration doesn't know how to respond They've got chaos So I would say
it looks like the Democrats and the NOS's and the protests are designed to
bring chaos because they are they're designed to bring chaos
Um so here's the things here are the things
which I think you're going to um find out about during the protests So
the protests will probably last a while They're they're mostly against uh I think all are against the ICE roundups
So they're they're opposed to rounding people up ice and sending them back Um
but here are the things I expect you will see Number one you'll start seeing
evidence dribbling out about which entities are involved and you'll say to
yourself "Oh wow That's very artificial." Now it starts out people
look at the news they see people running around they say "Wow there's a pretty
big uh movement against these deportations."
But is there really is there a big movement against deportations probably not It's probably
people who are paid to protest and then some of them get out of control Some of
them are true believers but you're not seeing anything that would tell you the you know the sizing of the protest It's
probably minuscule honestly Or let's put it another way If if they were not being
paid how many of the protesters would have picked this issue the ICE stuff as
the thing that they think most needs to get fixed don't you think they'd be doing
something with climate change or you know uh income
distribution or uh stopping
war yeah the the fact that they've randomly not randomly uh because it's
all fake protests The fact that they've latched on this one issue is pretty much
all the evidence you need that is fake and it's paid for and you're not seeing anything like a natural
response So I think you'll see stuff dribble in about that I think you'll see
stories about somebody staging bricks near the events Have we seen that yet
it's just so obvious There'll always be a story about why was there a pile of
bricks in this place where they knew there would be protesters So that's probably coming We know that Antifa will
be implicated We know that communists will be implicated We know that there
will be lots of printed signs that are sort of a dead giveaway that they have funding and
organization And of course they'll be trying to unmask the ICE
agents So it's sort of a summer fake protest season in which you can kind of you know
in advance pretty much everything that's going to happen So it's coming
Um according to the uh postmillennial senator uh Chris Van
Holland he's the one who went down to try to free that Maryland dad Um but uh so he's the one who
traveled to El Salvador to do that But now he says the Trump administration
needs to apologize to Garcia for deporting him Now if you didn't know
Garcia has been returned Uh but he's probably not happy about it because he's
returning because there's a very long list of charges against him which will
probably put him in jail forever So did he win did the did the lawyers you know
score a victory did the people who wanted more process then did they get what they
wanted so here's what I think I think that every time a Democrat asks
Republicans or the Trump administration to apologize to anyone for anything I think
they should do it But it should be hilarious that it should all be wife
apologies You know the kind where the husband does the apology but if you were
listening to it you would know for sure that it was insincere
I don't think anything could be funnier than Republicans agreeing to always
apologize Yes I apologize for letting them in the country as long as we
did All right I think there's a probably a funny solution to all
this Uh meanwhile according to the Defense Post the the US is unveiling a new
project will they give you a $20 million prize for developing the best fasttrack
drone innovation so next generation of
drones So does that tell you that
um anybody in their garage can make a drone i I'm kind of wondering have we reached
a point where the hardware pretty much does everything you
want it to do but the only thing that's different is the software because then
if it's the software then it would allow lots of people to compete for the you
know the better drone because the software would be easy But if they had to invent I don't know a more efficient
motor or something there'd be a lot less uh lot fewer people doing that Although
probably by now there are 20 probably 20 different companies who are trying to
make more efficient drone uh engines I'll bet you
Um meanwhile over in Ukraine the Ukrainians have uh invented
this is also according to the Defense Post a anti- drone pistol
So if it's the kind of drone that can be jammed which would not include the ones
that are tethered by optical cable which are the main ones being used right now
but uh you could just point your little anti- drone weapon at it and would give you uh 50
watts and take out that drone I don't know if I would depend on
the anti- drone pistol I've got a feeling that's not going to
be nearly as effective as they hope I don't know According to the BBC
uh the pandemic generation of kids um they're damaged permanently or could
be could be permanently But here's what uh here's what one teacher said Now this
is not based on a study This is based on one teacher's observations Um Rebecca Underwood she said there is
something different about class of 2023 Um for the the kids between five
and six years old they're physically more cautious And uh then this this quote
caught my eye Quote "Many kids are not able to roll not able to jump on two
feet They are very hesitant to climb And I thought to
myself really we have we have six-year-olds who
cannot be taught to jump on both feet Really that's uh way worse than I
imagined it would be but I don't believe it Yeah I think if she did a bigger study Uh this is just
anecdotal So I think she might have some weird kids in her class All
right ladies and gentlemen that's all I have for today So Sunday it's time for
you all to go do your Sunday things I'm going to say hi to the uh people on locals
privately but the rest of you I'll see you tomorrow Same time same place I hope
you like that the shows are a little bit shorter I'd hate for you to be hating
that but sometimes there's just not that much to say
