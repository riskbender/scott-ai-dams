everybody let's get our comments working and then we got something you're ready for it
yeah you ready for it here we go
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to Coffee with Scott Adams
and uh you probably never had a better time but if you'd like to take this experience up to levels that no one
could even understand with their tiny shiny human brains
well for that you're going to need a copper mug or a glass a tank or shelves
or sign a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the
thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip it happens
that's right right now go
you'll always remember where you were when you took your first simultaneous
sip okay you were in front of your computer
all right being that it is Saturday uh immediately after the podcast will be
a spaces event that's the audio only event on X and Owen Gregorian will be
hosting that you can find that on his uh X feed owen Gregorian just search for
him you'll find it well happy Flag Day
and happy Trump's birthday and happy Mega King Day
and happy what else is it um World War II victory day
did I leave anything out uh happy gay pride month
um any other birthdays does anybody else have a birthday I can
toss in there we got a lot going on
well apparently the Trump military parade will be at 6:30 p.m eastern time
so plenty of time to watch it and it turns out that there will be more horses
than tanks i I was worried that uh the parade would
be a substantial part of the military and maybe be a target or something but
it doesn't look like that it's a a smaller spectacle than I imagined
so when all of you heard it was going to be a military parade what did you
imagine because I imagined a bunch of missiles you know like uh Kim Jong-un does you
know those are the missiles u but apparently there are no missiles so here's here's what uh one chart I saw
this morning said uh 6700 soldiers
which is not a lot but it's not a little so you know good good chunk of soldiers
31 tanks uh 28 Bradley fighters 16
Blackhawk helicopters one Douglas C47
whatever that is there will be eight marching bands uh 34
horses and one dog i can't wait to to see the dog there's
just one dog yeah so we got 34 horses
and only 31 tanks so the good news is it's not uh
it's not meant to be overwhelmingly military it's it looks like it's just
about the right amount um if you had too much
it would look like you're trying to be a dictator if you don't have enough it
would look like you're weak so this might be just you know the right amount
for Flag Day so I'll say got that right uh but today
is also no Kings Day according to
who who decided that that is no kings day
well we'll talk about that who's behind it but um apparently for No Kings Day
the idea is that it's sort of a protest movement to Trump's military parade
because a military parade makes the Democrats think of dictators
which makes them think of kings which makes them want to say no kings so it's
a anti-Trump sort of national event
um apparently Whimo has announced that they will not be serving the area where the no kings will
be um having their their day in Los Angeles uh instead they're going to shut down
service so instead of ordering a Whimo
there's going to be way more walking than they expected
yeah I'll say it twice there's going to be way more walking
all right so uh here's what General Flynn
said about the event the no kings event um I'll
just read you why you posted right so General Flynn uh I've been in the intelligence game
long enough to know a scop when I see one the no king's protests aren't
spontaneous they're part of a broader strategy to undermine President Trump's
administration the NOS's involved Indivisible Churla
Union Del Bario and others are part of a network of nearly 200 organizations
many of which have ties to the Democratic Party's activist wing
uh he says the FBI is sniffing around with director Cash Patel probing the
funding behind the recent anti-ICE riots in LA uh why because when protests turn
into looting and arson it's not about free speech it's about intent to
destabilize now so that's General Flynn who knows
what he's talking about um believes that the protests are meant
to destabilize the country they're not really you know an anti-Trump per se
um I told you the other day uh that um Chris Cuomo
um you believe that China is be behind the funding of the of the
anti-immigration stuff anyway and maybe this too so why would China do that
because the more protests and unrests there are in the United States the
better it is for China according to China I guess Mayor Adams of New York
City no relation according to the New York Post he's going to deploy thousands of cops
uh for the no king's day he wants to make sure that uh the outside agitators
are handled because he expects a lot of outside agitators
now I always wonder if you're if you're one of these uh groups that fund some big
you know fake fake protest like this is party or thinking that there will
always be outside agitators and you don't have to invite them or are they
invited or are they you know known to be on your
list of invitees so you don't have to do anything special you're always going to get somebody
who'll do something violent i always wonder do they plan the violent ones or
do they just know that if you do a big event violent people always show up so
kind of a mystery there well the uh all the protests will be
overshadowed by whatever happens in Israel and Iran and as you know probably by now Israel
is still going after Iranian um nuclear and military well missile sites in
particular but military sites still going after scientists
and uh I've got an open question because one of the one of the stories about this
war which may or may not be 100% true is that
Mossad does this super clever trick we don't know the details to get the
generals to go to the same room and stay in that room long enough for a missile
to go through the wall and kill all of them now the part they're not telling us
is how do they get them all to go to the same room when obviously they would know that
might be dangerous and did it involve AI
because we're we're sort of that place all right imagine if you will
that the first thing that uh Israel does is shuts down whatever private secure
communication um the generals had so let's say that's
you know first thing they do is just shut that down but they don't turn off their cell phones
and I Yeah I'm just speculating this is this is just imaginary but now imagine that Israel did a deep
fake using AI of one of the uh you know generals
saying uh our skewer communications are down uh meet me at this room and they
think "Oh I'm just meeting one general so I better go." And let's say it's a
voicemail so there's no interaction so if you sent a message when you knew I
would go to voicemail and it sounded exactly like your boss who who happened
to be a general and he said our secure communications have been taken down but
meet me at that place we always go to you know that room or whatever would you
go well you might so I'm just I'll make
this an open question um is this the first time that AI has
been used to get people to to do do something they wouldn't have
normally done go to one room at the same time uh so that they could be attacked i
don't know but MSAD is not telling us their secret trick for getting them all
in the same room and keeping them there um we're we're also seeing what I call
the dumpification strategy which I think works now the
dumpification strategy is you keep taking out the uh the top generals
until you get down to a general who's not very good at being a general and that's the last person in charge
because it seems to me that it's rare to get you know some really gifted military
genius aggressive general and by the time you get to like the 20th best
general they're not that good are they you know maybe they're more loyal than they are
experienced so I think part of Israel's strategy is to just get rid of all the smart ones
uh General Millie be nice
if you get rid of all the the smart ones um you don't have to get rid of the rest
because it wouldn't be able to do much so I think that's happening some people are saying that Iran is the weakest it's
been in however many decades do you think that's true do you think Iran is
at its weakest its proxies have largely been decapitated you know like Hezbollah
etc so that that part is true their air defense seems to be entirely gone
um but they do have still a little bite uh they've got an economy that at least
for now Israel is uh allowing their oil industry to stay intact because obviously they
could take it out if they want to and they might you know there there's a point at which they might do that we're
not there yet um so is Iran its weakest ever
uh economies probably a little bit uh shaken by it but they
still have their oil business which is a lot of what they do um and they still
have a gazillion missiles to send at Israel and
um at the moment I would imagine their best nuclear stuff is still intact
because it's so far underground now one of the mysteries is I saw a news report
that said that um America has these you know bunker buster miss uh bombs that
Israel does not but even if we gave them the bombs they would have no uh aircraft to deliver
them because they don't have the bombers they have mostly fighters so
but at the same time I saw a report that said that Israel could take out those uh
you know deeply buried uh underground facilities in Iran but they would use
some different technique now do you believe that i asked Grock
how Israel could do it uh if they didn't have the bunker
busters and it basically gave a lot of suggestions but they were
all low odds of success so Grock doesn't know any way Israel
could do that and I'm even wondering if our bunker busters could do it cuz I may
have read it wrong but isn't there uh their biggest remaining underground
facility isn't it something like 50 miles underground
like no matter how big your bunker buster was there's still a limit right i
mean you can't bunker bust absolutely everything that's underground
can you maybe you can you know maybe it causes such an earthquake that you know
even the internal stuff collapses i don't know so
one of my questions is um can Israel effectively take out these
you know facilities i would think that if they got rid of whatever Iranian
uh military were guarding it because they could you know bomb anything that's
external that if they could get to the doorway and penetrate the doorway
there's probably a way to do that right just penetrate the doorways
um seems like you could kind of kill everybody who's in there if
there's anybody in there i mean there might not be any people in there might only be assets
so bit of a mystery whether Israel could uh take care of the deeply buried stuff
i don't know anyway uh the Ayatollah Ali Kami
did I say that correctly um he's like 85 years old
and he's the architect of everything that Iran is at the moment
meaning you know he put together the proxies i mean maybe he didn't start it but yeah he was the the person who
formed Iran into the country it is right now now imagine being that guy
where you had all these big plans for Iran to be the you know the big dog in a
neighborhood and it looked like it was working you know you were getting all
these proxies and Hezbollah was armed to the teeth and you know you had you had
just all kinds of things going on that made you look like you were in charge and then you're 85
and you watch Israel take all of that away from you like a little bit at a
time well there goes Hezbollah well there goes the head if you're
military and the backup guy and the backup guy and the backup guy
well there goes you know your international trade
um at the at the moment they still have the oil facilities but who knows so
imagine being in his head do you think there's any chance that
that guy can say "You know what um you've taken everything I've had and
what I really want is revenge but what's good for my country is if I just make
peace." No way right so poor Iran is under
attack but they really have the one person in the entire world who has no
chance no chance of making peace so he's
going to go down with a ship don't you think and the ship is this country
and Israel's not really going to have any choice they're either going to have
to you know take over and tip over the whole country or they're going to have
to let it reform into the same uh the same risk it was before and I don't
think they're going to do that so um it looks to me like the Supreme
Leader will be circling the drain and taking his entire country with him
because I doubt he can separate his country's well-being from his own
so that's a problem the uh Wall Street Journal points out
that that we don't know how successful uh Israel's raid is
um you know I mentioned that uh they haven't gotten through the blast doors
yet of the the big Ford enrichment site um and if they don't do that it will
feel like they did not succeed so one of the biggest goals is not accomplished it
might be later but at the moment no um there's also something called a pickaxe
mountain that apparently uh that also hasn't been
destroyed because that's underground um also this is from still from the Wall
Street Journal the uh top top top nuclear engineer is still alive so
apparently there's some MIT educated nuclear engineer who is the head of it
all who is successfully alive so far
so if Israel stopped today there would be two nuclear facilities
that we don't know much about because they're deep underground and the head of all of it
would still be alive so how long would it take them to reconstitute
[Music] wouldn't be that long
um but on the plus side for Israel
uh Iran would know by now that its entire national security structure has
been penetrated by MSAD so if you were Iran you couldn't trust
anyone because the uh I'm assuming that all the
assets that Israel has that make that allows them to do all the internal stuff
that they're doing in Iran like smuggling in missiles and stuff like that or smuggling in drones as part of
their attack those are Iranians right it's not like there are Jewish people pretending to be
Iranian citizens i doubt I I assume it would be Iranian
citizens who for whatever reason u have decided to side with Israel instead of
their own country but there must be more than a few of them and I assume that they oppose their
own leadership i guess I mean by definition
so Israel has a number of cities under attack i don't know the number but uh
Tel Aviv as one of them and uh some say that Iran tried to attack the
equivalent of uh Israel's Pentagon um I haven't heard if they if they got any of
it and apparently reportedly the US is
aiding and shooting down some of the missiles so doesn't that make us directly part of
the war or do we say "Oh no no shooting
down missiles is not really part of the war we're just you know on the sidelines
watching and sometimes we shoot down a missile but we're not part of it i don't
know i guess we're getting away with that sort of meanwhile
um I told you this before but uh John Fedman Senator Fedman he's uh he's
calling for the US to supply quote anything Israel needs for their attack
or their war I guess um so Fedman is
more staunchly for Israel than just about anybody else now does that include
bunker buster bombers would uh would Fedman be in favor of the
US joining with not only our bunker busters but flying you know because our
own pilots would have to fly the bombers israel doesn't have the bombers
would he be in favor of that because that would be I think he would
be by the way but uh that would be pretty radical position for a Democrat
very pro-war and my my question is this who would be
better off if America gets dragged further into that war is there anybody
who would be better off would Iran be better off no no iran does not want
America to be more involved in the war because we have more offensive you know
weapons than Israel does does um America
want us to be more involved in the war well some do but I would I would think
that by a majority Americans would not be not want to be involved or more
involved because we're you know at at the very least we're helping them to shoot down missiles
so I don't think America or Iran would like it but you're probably thinking to yourself well Israel obviously would
like it you know if America joined in a full force way but I'm not sure
because Israel has shown itself so capable
that with the one exception of can they get to that underground stuff you know do they really have a way to do it
without our direct help if they can then wouldn't even Israel be better off
if the United States stays out of it because if you were if you're Israel
don't you want to send a credible threat to you know future
future threats in other words there might be a future where Iran is once
again a threat do you want them to think "Oh America
will stop them from attacking you know they're they're America's little puppy
they they can't put up an attack unless America says yes and America's you know bing at it."
I think Israel is better off if it looks like they can make their own decisions
free of American constraints and if they have enough military might
that they don't need any American help whatsoever they they can absolutely
dominate Iran without any American direct help you know except shooting
down a few missiles so I would argue that we're in a weird
situation where there is no country on earth that benefits by the US getting
more dragged into the war not either side i think both sides would say "Yeah
maybe stay out." just you know again I'm speculating
because I can't read the minds of the Israeli leadership but it kind of looks
like you know if if you had asked Israel before they started bombing do you want
America involved they might have said yes because you know it looked like a stronger force but
now that they've been so successful uh without our direct
allegedly direct involvement at this point I feel like they would say
you know what we can we can take care of this so it could be nobody wants us to
be more involved which would be good
um however Iranian officials according to just the news uh they are
saying that uh the US should be held quote fully accountable for the recent
escalations uh because we're a quote backer of
Israel so we're going to get blamed either way
but will we be attacked which is the important thing um at the
moment there's some kind of cyber attack that's making some shelves empty at Whole Foods but we don't know who the
attacker is it doesn't mean it's Iran it could be just some uh blackmail attacker
so we're not seeing any obvious attack by
Iran on American assets at the moment but uh that might happen
uh because Iran has threatened to hit some military bases within reach
um so Mossad allegedly smuggled in all
these uh these exploding drones into Iran ahead of the attack so MSNBC is
even sort of touting that uh success and I told you before that whenever
Israel does a a military event of any kind that there there
there's immediately immediately there's some story of amazing competence like oh
my god how did they pull that off and that took a lot of planning and that show was smart they made those pagers
explode or whatever it was so the the legend that's being formed now is that
the MSAD smuggled in a bunch of drones so that they were local when the
shooting started so that the drones didn't have to go too far to destroy some I think the air air defenses i
think that's what they went after um but that's a to that's a kind of
story that um I don't fully trust because it's
it's a you know it's a little bit on the nose it's like okay I get it you're all
you're all military geniuses and you're adversaries are not um
and maybe it's true it might might be 100% true but either way it creates a uh
a feeling within Iran that they're totally penetrated
and that has got to be really you know a problem when you're trying to
figure out how to respond because you wouldn't know who to trust these uh MSAD
agents are they Jewish you know was was there were there a
bunch of uh Israeli MSAD agents who were somehow within Iran
and were doing all this stuff with these explosive drones and then they got away
or were they Iranian citizens that had been co-opted to do this one
way or the other i don't know so um
and then uh on X data Republican is
asking this question that others are asking too the uh postmillennials asking
it as well um after seeing what these MSAD agents did because they could get
the drones right next to the assets that were going to attack
um why are we allowing China to own farmland next military bases in the
United States because it seems like we're putting ourselves at the same risk that Iran was
which is if China has figured out how to get a bunch of drones that they're
hiding on the farmland that's right next to our military bases
um you know is that a risk that we could take well
uh there's a map that uh I see an X all the time that shows these fairly
enormous Chinese land holdings in in all the various states and
I wonder if that's the scale because if that's the scale it's really
frightening but if it's not um you know it might be a totally illegitimate uh
graph i don't know i don't trust it
but if it's real it does suggest that there's Chinese um owned farmland right
next to a lot of our bases and that's not no risk that's definitely a
greater risk i don't know if the right I don't know enough about this to know if the right answer is to
you know deny China ownership of these places they they bought
um but it does seem like a pretty big risk
anyway um so apparently President Trump
told uh uh Bash that uh the people the people that the
US was negotiating with with Iran are all dead
so my question is this wouldn't that be a big coincidence
if all the negotiators were coincidentally dead cuz they're not
generals right um
[Music] now all right so here here's the kind of  up comment that you need to quit
all right justin account says "Scott's rare blind spot is thinking everybody is
basically American just different language and food." Now that's obviously a dumb comment
cuz you know that I don't think that and you're talking about me instead of
to me remember this is a two-way communication if you think I missed
something as in did you know this you could easily say that but um you sound
like a Democrat have you noticed that the Democrats I if
I'm if I'm debating with a Republican a Republican will say you know
you're not aware of this or maybe maybe you should incorporate this into your
model when I when I deal with a Democrat
they imagine I have character flaws and this is how they treat everybody they
treat Trump and everybody the same they imagine a bunch of character flaws that
they can somehow see that are invisible to other people and that those character
flaws tell you everything you need to know about policy or opinion
that that is so Democrat to go to to imagine that you have some
kind of weird you know insight into my internal thoughts and that my internal
thoughts are all messed up how would you know
you you would know nothing all right but uh Trump says the negotiators are
all dead which makes me assume that the Israelis targeted them
now what if they did because they did it's not like they targeted you know every member of the um
the leadership because they were mostly going after the military people but did
they do the military people plus the negotiators
because they knew that if any of the negotiators stayed alive uh Trump would
try to negotiate with them it's kind of clever in a brutal way i I
feel like I feel like Trump is suggesting that Israel killed the negotiators
just to make sure there was nobody to negotiate with do you think that's what happened it
looks like it we'll never know but it looks like it
anyway uh in other news you know the the poor Senator Alex Padilla
you know he tried to make news by uh talking out at that Christy Gnome event
but then the uh security took him out well it was sort of like the drama i
call the Democrats drama it was like they all got their new script and
they're like "Okay we're done with the Maryland dad." That didn't work out as well as we hoped we're moving on to if
they can arrest a senator oh my god if they can arrest a senator imagine
imagine what they can do to you and then they would all take turns trying to see
who could who could act like it was the worst by their attitude not by anything
they said right um by the way uh CNN had
a security expert on on to talk about that take down of Senator Padilla and
the uh security guy said on CNN that the
security did a good job and that they did what they should do which is they
saw a uh an unknown threat and without any violence whatsoever they
neutralized it so and they did it quickly and they did it efficiently
so I watched it and I thought to myself "Yeah actually that's looks like good
work." Um and I think I said that but uh MSNBC's Nicole Wallace called it one of
the bleakest days of her entire anchoring career
how many of you think that the uh the temporary handcuffing of one senator who
was causing trouble and nobody recognized how many of you think that was one of the bleakest days of her
entire anchoring career do you think she took it a little too
far well the uh the game we're playing is that the dramcrats
have to almost compete with each other to see who can make it sound like it was
worse oh my god if they could take down a senator
what will they do to me next oh
well once you realize that the entire game is uh drama theater and when they
get a new script they all have to adapt to it it's like oh god oh no the
Maryland dad no okay we're done with him uh do you have the new new script okay
new script uh Alex Padilla Senator oh Senator oh
anyway according to the New York Post
um there was some kind of USID bribery for contract scheme that got busted and
it was a $550 million bribery scheme now the bribery was only I think a million
dollars which is still a lot of bribery but uh one uh individual is charged with
getting a $1 million bribe in return for directing USID money to specific
consulting companies Apprio and Vistant now does that sound like exactly what
you thought was going on with these NOS's um I won't say I always know it
uh I'll just say that uh recently it became obvious and uh uh Elon Musk has
uh indicated this might be just the you know the top of the iceberg but that uh
the USID thing was just a perfect money laundering
situation that nobody was watching you know there was there was nobody in charge it looked like and the entire
thing was about people rece receiving large amounts of money from the government and then redirecting that
money now how does that not go wrong
you're you're really just begging for money laundering and corruption and
theft and that you know why would anybody direct a contract anywhere
unless they were getting a huge bribe and they could easily hide the bribe in the you know the web of NOS's connected
to other NOS so of course
um and I think we're going to be shocked by the size of the the fraud you know um
we may never get to the bottom of it but my god the the amount that our
government was sending to people who were sending to people who were sending to people
uh it's just crazy and there was just no control
speaking of crazy um remember how we used to laugh and say if
a if a news story started with a Florida man because Florida was you know it seemed
like Florida was being a little ridiculous for a while a Florida man and then there would be some crazy thing
that Florida man did well California's got a version of that now so now we've
got a representative uh Norma Torres Democrat um and she just said that President
Trump needs to reimburse Los Angeles for the anti-ICE riots
what so so Trump is supposed to be responsible financially
meaning the government for the anti-government protests
as if they don't have financial backers don't you think the financial backers of
the protest should be paying for any uh extra expense
may maybe that's the treatment maybe maybe if you were uh financially backing
a protest and the protest created a extra expense you know police expense
and clean up of graffiti and repairs and stuff maybe the people who funded it
would be on the hook for that [Music] h
I'm loving this idea even as I'm having it because
that would be pretty expensive now the people who are funding it apparently are
billionaires in China in some case so it'd be hard to get to them but uh they
should be paying for it even the increase in police they should be paying for all that
so we'll see meanwhile um the Postmillennials reporting that uh
a judge has blocked uh the Trump administration's executive
order how many times have you heard this a federal a a judge has blocked the
Trump administration executive order and then fill in the blank it's like there's
a hundred of them um and this one is for citizenship verification in federal
elections so um Trump's executive order had a few
things in it but one of them was that you had to check ID and make sure
somebody was a citizen before they could vote and a judge has blocked that now
the reason is that uh the reason given anyway is
that the constitution does not give the president that authority
now the argument that's coming from the Trump administration why they do have
that authority is weak because their argument is that it's just
common sense that you check IDs well it is it is common sense that you just
check IDs and make some make sure somebody's a citizen but you don't have
the constitutional authority to mandate that common sense so
unfortunately the judge I think has the right you know
the right decision in terms of the law there there's no authority that would support uh that executive order but
we'll see i don't think it's done i think uh there's going to be more more
appeals to that so So maybe there's more to come we'll see
well in the uh what I call the photo op competition where the uh anti-ICE people
are trying to get the best photograph they did pull ahead with that uh Senator
Padilla thing but we've already forgotten it so it's it's closer to a
tie again but here's According to the Hill here's the the most exciting thing
that happened in the uh uh the anti-ICE protests that I call the photo op
competition uh one Marine detained one guy temporarily
and then handed him over to Homeland Security now apparently the Marines
can't arrest anybody but they can temporarily detain somebody and then
turn them over to you know non-military authority which is what they did so the
best we got in the photo op competition and I didn't even see a photo was one
Marine detaining one guy temporarily that's the best I got that one Marine
detaining one guy temporarily
um and most of these Marines if not all of them are there to protect federal
property and personnel so so in theory there there shouldn't be too many
photograph of that anyway
um there's a uh survey that the college fix
is writing about in which they tried to see how many colleges got rid of DEI
versus just rebranded it and kept it um and they found this is very unscientific
but they found 87 schools simply renamed their DEI offices and kept them but 78
schools it looks like they got rid of DEI you know as they were legally obligated to
do now um of the ones who got rid of DEI
they tended to be located in Republican strongholds as we call them so roughly
the same number cheated actually more uh and renamed their DEI offices compared
to those that closed it makes me wonder how those colleges that kept it are
certified is there any There's no federal government certification right they
can't descertify a college because it seems like you'd want to know that like
if you were interviewing a graduate from one of those colleges wouldn't you rather know
if they kept their DEI office and renamed it or if they got rid of it i'd
kind of want to know that because it would tell me what I'm getting with the graduate
all right but I don't think the government has much uh leverage there
um apparently according to CBS News uh Barbie Maker and Mattel and Open AI have
formed a uh some kind of agreement to develop AI powered toys do you think
that's a good idea do you want your child to have AI powered toys
well on one hand it's inevitable and it's legal and you know of course it's
coming on the other hand does it seem to you that your child
would be raised by his own toys because if your toys can talk to you and
they have some form of intelligence they will be programmed so that at least the
child version of them is as helpful as possible so will your dolls tell you to brush
your teeth will your GI Joe tell you i mean that's
probably not Mattel but will your Barbie tell you um that you only have five more minutes
before you have to head off to school because you you might
I mean this literally um those of you have kids you've you've
uh probably experienced that you have a lot of you have a lot of uh influence
over the child when they're young when they're very young but the minute they go to school
the school is raising your kid because whatever it is you're giving
them at home um gets harder and harder and whatever they're picking up at school is stickier
and stickier so in effect you raise your kids for the first you know six years
and then they go to school and then I'd say the state the state raises them now
you can do as much as you want when they come home but there's just something
about that going to school experience and that the peer peer association
that uh effectively the the state and your peer their peers are raising them
don't you think that's going to happen with toys if they have AI your toys will
actually raise your kid because that's where they'll get all their tips and
encouragement and compliments and things that parents forget to do you know even
their love maybe so it's inevitable
but a little bit unpredictable
well uh according to NBC News there's uh some Philadelphia postal workers who
were charged with stealing 80 million in US Treasury checks
now they they didn't manage to get them all cashed through some you know third
party mechanism but they did cash 11 million of them
um so the US postal workers were just
looking for you know these uh government checks and whatever they found them they
just stole them now how many times have I told you that
if you have a situation where it's possible for fraud that over time you
always get it well here's one of those situations now they didn't get away with
it but they got away with it after I mean they they got away with
stealing $80 million before they got caught
um and then in a related story New York Post there's the an ex Illinois house
speaker who was the longest serving legislative leader in US history was sentenced in a
corruption case so are you surprised that the longest
serving legislative leader in the US was involved in corruption
no you should not be surprised by that because in my opinion if you were to
list all the legislative leaders by how long they've been in office the
corruption would be perfectly aligned with how long they've been in office because you know why they stay in office
until they're 100 years old to cover up their corruption
is it a coincidence that it's an ex Illinois house speaker
because I feel like if this person had still been in power that maybe there
never would have been any investigation so I think and this is just the Scott
Adams opinion that when you see somebody like Schumer or you know any any of the
ones who are way too old to still be in office even Joe Biden that the reason
that they stay in office of Nancy Pelosi is because they have to maintain power
so they don't get prosecuted now there obviously there would be
exceptions to this rule but I'll bet there's a really direct correlation
between how old you are how long you've been in office and how corrupt you are
i'll bet it's connected i'd be surprised if it's not
all right so here's a uh here's a new study i want you to see if this study
was necessary or is it could they have just asked me could they have just asked
Scott all right so according to the conversation
um premenstrual dysphoria dysphoric disorders
uh do they harm relationships or not right so that's a question and this
premenstrual dysphoric disorder has the following um symptoms right it affects
uh 2% of people who menstruate um I'm going to call them women
people who menstruate mostly women i mean not all of them
um so do you think that if somebody had the
following uh predictable symptoms that would affect the relationship
uh brain fog stomach cramps bloating mood swings anger sadness low self-worth
anxiety and even thoughts of self harm now if your partner exhibited those
symptoms do you think your relationship would be as good as if they didn't
all right you're way ahead of me yeah I don't think they needed to study this um
because if you're having this many symptoms that definitely is affecting
your relationship there there's no way around that so yes they did not need to
study this they could have just asked Scott
well speaking of Scott um we are at the end of my prepared
notes and that means that it's time for the spaces that will be led by Owen
