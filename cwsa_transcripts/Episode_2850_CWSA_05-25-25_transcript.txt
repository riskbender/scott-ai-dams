there you are Let's get all my comments working and then we got to have some
fun Perfect
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's called Coffee with
Scott Adams And if you'd like to take this experience up to levels that nobody can understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a copper mugger glass a tanker chalister
stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any kind Fill it with your favorite
liquid I like coffee And join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day The thing to make everything better It's called a simultaneous sip And it happens now
Go Divine exquisite
perfection Well it's Sunday and uh you've decided to spend it with
me and I appreciate it Well according to Neoscope nearly half of young people
wish the internet had never been invented So there's a new survey in the
UK Now does that surprise you i think you could put that in the category of things you didn't just ask
me because wouldn't you expect that at least half of young people are having a
terrible experience with the internet you know they're getting bullied or they're not attractive or nobody follows
their page Yeah So that's probably the least
surprising survey results of all time They should have just asked me
Well here's some Tesla news Um according to Tesla imagine you
need to drop off something on the other side of town Are you imagining that
instead of driving there yourself and wasting your time in traffic your car will be able to run that errand on its
own while you work or do other things On the way back it could bring you your
coffee order without high delivery fees So how does it deal with the the vendors
on the other side i can see how the card goes from one place to another by itself but how
does the coffee person know to stick the coffee in the
car do they have to do they have to leave the Starbucks and open the car and
put it in the center divider i don't know So I think I need a
robot in my car But then we're then we have everything I want an Optimus robot
in my self-driving car and I wanted to go get my coffee
Yeah that'll be good You may have heard that uh Elon Musk uh in part because X
had a kind of a a downtime yesterday
he's decided to go back to work 24/7 sleep at the office and make sure his
stuff works again So that's always a good sign when when Elon Musk decides that
he's going to sleep in the office anywhere usually good things happen So
uh I feel sorry for him sleeping in the office but I like the fact that X is
going to be stable Speaking of Tesla um Attorney
General Pam Bondi says she's got three more of the Tesla terrorists I call them
Tesla domestic terrorists um that she's prosecuting And all three
defendants will face the full force of the law for using Molotov cocktails to
set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations Now how happy are you that just
because Elon Musk left Doge or at least you know the everyday doing and went
back to work in his main company that all of a sudden all the domestic terrorism changed It just went away
Doesn't that tell you that it wasn't real doesn't that tell you that it was
just organized by you know various moneyed forces and that as soon as he
was out of the way well no reason to do any of this terrorism
So good news there if you're a Tesla stock owner Here's something I was
predicting would happen but might happen sooner than I thought Um
apparently the US has a plan to to mine
lithium in the United States but they've got a new technology that can uh that is being
compared to the shale revolution remember when we were running out of uh
oil and then somebody said "Hey you we've got this new technology that can
get us the oil from these shale uh environments." And then suddenly we
had all kinds of oil Well apparently there are underground brine reserves or
reservoirs flowing across Arkansas So Arkansas is sitting on a gold mine of
lithium and if it's a Brian reservoir and this one's so big it could
apparently take care of the United States for 20 years Uh they've got this
new technology where they don't have to spend a lot of money to get the lithium
out of the brine So it's not perfect and uh there's at least one
company that's been trying to do this for a while and not doing well but apparently we do know the
technology So there's a a way to cheaply get lithium They just have to tweak it
until it works just right So I'd been sort of
predicting that with these rare earth minerals and the lithium and stuff that
the process of mining it would get easier thanks to technology And sure
enough lithium here we come Well Lockheed Martin has decided
it's going to stop its DEI initiatives Um that would be following Trump's order
to stop discriminating The National Pulse is writing about this And
uh if you're Lockheed Martin don't you depend on government
contracts quite a bit So kind of smart that they're doing that don't you think
they didn't have much choice They're going to have to obey the law the law of the land But anyway they're getting rid
of DEI Anderson Cooper asked Rahm Emanuel on
CNN if uh Rahm is going to run for president And uh here's the way he asked
and here's the answer Let's see if you can tell tell what the truth is So Cooper said Nancy Pelosi made headlines
today u by saying she thinks you're running for president Are you all right
Now listen to this answer What I'm going to do is take time to think about not just how to fight Donald
Trump although that's worthy of doing but how to fight for the American
people That's sort of a guess isn't it now he could change his mind but
that's a pretty good indication he wants to run for president He I I think he'd
be a strong candidate So I would worry about him if I were if I were worried about a
Democrat becoming president I'd worry about him But at least he's not a crazy one You know he as Democrats go he would
be the least crazy Democrat So he's got that going for him
Meanwhile the SPLC Southern Poverty Law Center has uh
labeled uh the Turning Point USA organization a hate
group and they've added them to their hate map
Now remember how I always tell you that if you know what happened you might not
know anything But if you know who was involved well now you might know
something So if you thought that the uh Southern Poverty Law Center was a
totally legitimate organization operating independently to tell us where
the hate is Well you'd be very surprised It's more like a Democrat you
know basically an attack dog for the Democrats And Turning Point USA has been
doing a tremendous job of uh public events And Charlie Kirk in particular
has been just killing it on these public events where he's sort of debating
people in public And the other thing you need to know is that if your job is to identify
ghosts are you going to find any ghosts of course you will Of course you will If
your job is to identify Bigfoots are you going to find any
Bigfoots of course you are cuz you get paid for it If your job is to identify
hate groups are you going to find some new hate groups every year or are you
going to find all the ones that exist and then you then you say you know we don't even need to any funding for the
next year I don't even know why we have a staff We found all the hate and we did
our map So uh maybe we'll you know check back in a year to update it No they get
us staff They get a budget They're going to find some extra
hate So you can't trust anybody who gets paid by the amount of hate they deter
that they identify They're going to find some hate
But is it real no Turning Point USA is is nothing like a group Not even close
Well a a Texas state representative who because of the nature
of the story you need to know is a black woman is pushing for racebased classroom
assignments So she claims that the science shows that students perform
better when they're taught by teachers who share their skin color So her idea
is that white people would have a white teacher black people would have a black teacher
etc I saw this in the Amuse account on X
Um so I'd like to give you some advice If this topic ever comes up
wherever you are and you're a white person you you want to act like the
studies are all incorrect and and act like this is totally racist
and you would never you would never be anywhere near it because you could get
cancelled for saying that kind of thing Yeah you don't want to get cancelled So
just say "Oh I think those studies are flawed The very best teacher could be
any kind of thing." Which is true Anyway according to the Gateway
Pundit Harvard is admitting that Trump's crackdown on Harvard and some other
universities is having a quote devastating impact on Harvard but
they're going to keep fighting anyway Thank goodness They're going to keep fighting And how are they going to fight
well they're sending out the designated liars So Jamie Rascin is defending
Harvard When you see Jaime Rascin again it's not it's not what happened
it's who's involved And suddenly if Jaime Rascin appears he's a designated liar He's one
of the ones they send out when the normal people can't tell the lie So oh he'll take care of it He'll say it Um
but here's what JD Vance says about the university situation He did a he did a
lengthy post today on Acts that I thought was worthy of um just reading to
you So JD Vance on the universities he says there is an extraordinary
reproducibility crisis in the sciences particularly in biology where most
published papers fail to replicate Most universities have massive bureaucracies
that inhibit the translation of basic research into commercial adoption The voting patterns of
university professors are so one-sided that they look like the election results of North Korea
And on top of all this many UN universities explicitly engage in racial
discrimination mostly against whites and Asians that violates the civil rights laws of this country Our universities
could see the policies of the Trump administration as a necessary corrective to these problems change their policies
and work with the administration to reform or they can yell fascism at basic
democratic accountability and drift further into irrelevance Now this is pretty
interesting because one of the things that I always thought something like Harvard was you know adding to the world
is all that excellent science you know because they they get these massive grants or they did before Trump stopped
them And uh you'd have all these top scientists doing all this top science
but as Vance points out half of the things they get reproduced not just there but in general are not uh can't
you can't be they can't be replicated Meaning it's fake science basically And
then even when they have things that can be replicated they got some kind of bureaucracy that stops them from
commercializing it So it sounds to me like the whole we'll
give you money so you make some science and then we're all better off sounds like that doesn't work at
all So yeah maybe they should look at fixing that instead of complaining about
Trump So JD Vance good communicator
And then we find in related news according to Med
Page today that you know how science always gets a peer review if it's good
science Well apparently there's a massive problem of peer reviewers having
financial conflicts How not surprising that is
Um the majority reviewing for top medical journals had conflicts and they
made uh a billion dollars in three years I don't know who made the billion
dollars the journals Anyway more than more than half of peer
reviewers for four top medical journals received payments from drug and medical
device manufacturers totaling a billion dollars from 2020 to
2022 according to an analysis of the open payments database
So you know that whole thing where you thought hey if I can appear
uh that's a pretty good indication that my science is good Apparently there's
nothing like that It looks like
uh it looks like the peer reviewers are basically beneficiaries of
you know big pharma and big medical So all you really need to do is find a peer
reviewer who's uh who will be willing to say something that big pharma would want
to hear and you're all set Speaking of uh Harvard
uh so you probably heard this story It's just the conclusion of it So the Harvard
Medical School morg So Harvard med medical school had a morg
uh not for the students but for donations of bodies So if the medical school wanted
to do some you know some uh dissecting or something of human bodies there was a
morg that would handle all that And apparently the morg manager was selling
organs on the black market but he wasn't selling them until
they were already used by the medical school So once the Harvard medical school was done with a body part um like
a hand you know you'd have like a severed hand Uh once they were done with it they were supposed to be disposed in
some legal way I guess But instead the uh morg manager was selling
them So it really gives meaning to secondhand
parts Secondhand parts because I'd use the hand more than once All right Well
that's all I got to know It does seem that wherever there can be corruption there is
corruption If it's possible it's going to happen Well let's see if there's anything more
like that According to the Blaze there's a North Carolina Democrat
who used pandemic loans to throw herself a lavish 50 at the birthday party
according to prosecutors So she got
$124,000 in loans And uh part of what she spent it on was a big old birthday party for
herself So that's another situation in which it was possible to have fraud and
there it was So the peer reviewers in science they
could be fraudulent and apparently they are The Southern Poverty Law Center could be
sketchy and apparently it is the uh morg director could be selling
his body parts and he was and uh during the pandemic a lot of the loans could be
fake and they were well but in other good news um
Liberty Nation News is reporting that crime is down across the US and uh we're
talking about the bad crimes the you know the murders and the rapes and stuff
Now the question would be and it's down for the first uh 3 months of this
year Now why do you think that is could it
be could it be because of the mass deportations of
criminals i don't know It's too early to know But if crime stays down everywhere
we're going to ask the question is that because Tom Hoben did an extra good job and he got rid of the really the
criminals who were repeat offenders it could be It that might be the reason
It's too early to know but could be
Um so here here's something that uh I'm
kind of happy about but I don't know if it's enough Our
government is sort of designed for doing certain things But one of the things our
government is not designed to do is uh be efficient and save your tax money and
not overspend because whoever cuts a budget ends up getting fired You know they
don't get elected Hey you cut that budget for whatever that good thing was
So we don't have any mechanism for a government that can do
anything except overspend your money uh until we all die But there's sort of a private
industry thing that's sort of filling that gap I don't know if it's enough to make a
difference but the all-in pod seems to be like a almost a national
treasure at this point because you got four of the smartest people you've ever
seen who are willing to talk about any topic that's important to the country
and they can do what Congress can't which is tell the truth
And I think that's an important step Now
telling the truth is only halfway to fixing a problem You still have to have
some mechanism to fix the problem which we don't but at least we're getting something like the
truth Um so so David Saxs one of the four in the all-in pod he was uh talking
about Doge I saw this on the Vigilant Fox um account they did a summary and he
said uh he said Doge made great progress I would agree Um but there's one thing
that Elon and Trump can't fix which is Congress So Congress would still have to
agree to all the doge cuts and that part is just broken
because Congress can't cut costs they would get fired meaning they would
lose their next election If they cut anything it wouldn't even matter what
they cut If they cut anything they would probably get
fired So Doge proved that you could find a lot of fraud You could identify it you
could you know at least at least have the possibility of cutting it but we
don't have anything that could actually cut it So that part had to be quite
disappointing for um Elon as well as
Trump But um
h there was a second part of this But then uh yesterday I saw a I
think it was they they called it an emergency um broadcast from the all-in pod So two
of the All- In guys were there Chimath and Freedberg and they were talking to Ron
Johnson Senator Johnson who's a uh I guess he was a Tea Party guy and he's
trying his best to figure out how to cut cost in the government but there just
there just doesn't seem to be any way to do it But I recommend that you watch it
because it's the most honest take on the trouble that we're
in because they can say in direct language we're in a death spiral and
absolutely nothing is going to change it unless we come up with some whole new
plan that nobody's thought of or nobody was brave enough to do or something But
um that was really valuable So I I'll say again I think the all-in
pod because the the four of them are so smart and so credible that when they
take on a topic like this where nobody's being honest about it it's the first
time the country can hear the honest the truth Basically it's the first time they
can hear the truth and in context because you know the news is all
biased and they don't even cover the the deficit Most of the time when uh the
news is talking about the budget they don't even mention they don't even mention the
fact All right Well there's a troll who needs to be disappeared
Let's get rid of the fart Joel
Anyway so most of the time when the news covers the budget
process even the big beautiful budget they don't tell you the only important
part This budget will kill us all That's the truth Now maybe not
tomorrow but if we don't figure out how to reduce the budget and we keep doing budgets like this where the deficit gets
bigger instead of smaller we're all dead So that's something the all-in pod can
say because it's true and it's demonstrabably true Um but we need that
extra part you know maybe it's Trump but it doesn't look like he has the the interest or
maybe even the ability to to cut it without uh losing the
midterms So uh I would uh recommend the all-in pod
for you so you're at least well informed on that topic And but
separately I think it was a different podcast I saw Freedberg say that uh there's some
theoretical amount of energy that if the United States could create this amazing
amount of energy uh the deficit wouldn't be a problem Now that's a sort of a thinker
and I think I missed part of it because I just saw a little clip on it Just think about that
that energy and money are sort of interchangeable because you know you
would use money to buy energy etc So if you had a way to create just a ton of
energy let's say nuclear fusion for example let's say tomorrow it became
cheap let's say somehow we figured out how to you know build a nuclear power
plant in one year you know These are things we can't do and I'm not predicting we can but there's
possibly one way we could escape the doom
spiral And you wouldn't know about it unless you'd watched the All-In podcast
explain that we're in a doom spiral But in theory if you could create a massive
amount of power you know electricity energy you there would be irrelevant
basically So anyway keep that in mind that they're like a national treasure
right now But we still need that last part where knowing the truth isn't
enough You got to be able to act on it And we still need that part where we act
on it Oh
wait All right Um here's something that I thought was
weird I I haven't seen anybody mention this yet but you've probably heard
before that the people in the news business they have to play nice with the
administration whoever that is because if they don't they'll lose access
Meaning that if they want an interview with somebody in the administration the administration might say "Oh you wrote a
hit piece about us yesterday so we're not going to give you anybody to do an interview." And then then you're in the
news business and you can't really do ordinary news and ordinary interviews so
you're really screwed So in the Biden administration you had this weird
situation where the where the news had to be nice to them to maintain
access but they didn't get any access cuz they're all they're all surprised that Biden was degraded and he
was basically being hidden from the you know hidden from the uh the news So
their business model of the the news is collapsing because their whole idea of
well at least if we're nice to you or nice enough we'll have access They
didn't get access They they didn't even get close to access They were not behind
the curtain whatsoever So I thought that was interesting
I saw I saw a Sam Harris clip where he was saying that he fell
for the idea that Biden was sharp when we weren't looking because he said you
know neurologically speaking uh that is an intelligible claim to make about a
person that he's he's capable making important decisions behind closed doors
But maybe he's not so good at communicating anymore Does that make sense to
you do you believe that if you saw him in public and he wasn't good at communicating and it was a big change
you know because he used to be better at it would you assume that he was fine behind closed
doors well Sam Harris did and uh the Daily Caller was talking
about this and it seems like uh a lot of
prominent anti-Trumpers are figuring out that they have to come clean that they were fooled And it's
getting safer because the the tapper book is you know drawing so much
fire And it's also making it easier for people to go public and say "Oh yeah
Yeah I guess Jake Tapper was fooled." And other people were fooled Oh yeah I
was fooled too Oh yeah Uh but of course of course I was fooled because I didn't
have access to the real information They were hiding it from me
All right If uh my engineer is watching this we really got to get rid of that guy I
think you know who I'm talking about All right Uh and
then I guess I would ask you this question If the political
experts were so bad at determining that Biden was
capable haven't the experts had a really bad 10 years do you remember when Trump was
first uh running for office in 2015 what did all the experts say about
his chances they said "No way." Right all of them All the experts
What did the cartoonist say he's going to be your next
president So that was a case of the experts having a really bad time Um and
then the experts got Biden's brain wrong and uh the experts got everything
about the budget wrong in my opinion And uh you probably want to say the experts
got a lot wrong on CO and the experts are not doing so good
on the peer-reviewed papers So what do you think are the experts
even worthwhile anymore i feel like the experts are not really doing well for
the past 10 years We've got a 10-year failure rate of
experts where where ordinary people are just like guessing and guessing
correctly I don't know I know It doesn't look like that to me And the guessers
are literally beating the experts like time and time again
So meanwhile uh NYU professor Scott Galloway I think
you know him Fox News is reporting that uh he's also coming clean you know about
his uh Biden support He says the Biden family's narcissism severely effed the country
Um basically he's blaming the Bidens for hiding his situation and you know and
then putting Kamla as the air apparent and uh he says it's uh the
Democratic party is hurting his legacy
Well I don't know if if all the non-experts could
clearly see that Biden was degraded can you really blame the
Democrats don't you have to blame the people who couldn't see the obvious it seems to
me Anyway um speaking of the budget the big beautiful budget So the Senate is
going to make their uh mark on it And uh as I mentioned Senator Ron Johnson he's
a he's he's a deficit guy He wants to make sure that we can pay our bills And
I guess Rick Scott and Mike Lee from Utah are similarly looking for bigger
cuts Do you think they're going to get them i I was looking at the list of
things that the Senate wants to tweak W- which by the way is a weird process to
me because you've got these you know two entities You've got the House and then you've got the Senate Isn't it the
weirdest thing that the House could vote on a bunch of elements in the budget and
then the Senate could just change them and then they would vote on it and it
would become a law or it would become the law of the land
It just seems like the worst system that there are two entities and one can
change what the first one just approved but that's what's happening Um and it
looks to me you know a quick look at what the senators are looking at
changing I'm not so sure this is going to pass because if the three um you know
deficit what do you call them deficit hawks you know the ones who are getting real serious about
overspending That's probably enough to hold things up isn't it so we'll see if
they can hold tight but uh yeah I'm not so sure the big beautiful bill is going
to pass as easily as people thought
Uh Mike Benz was uh talking to Alex Marlo on a podcast and he had a uh great
turn of a phrase that I wanted to share with you and he was talking about the
National Endowment for Democracy Now whenever there's a Mike
Benton story there's usually some kind of a three-word government entity that's
dealing with some some other three-word government entity and they're doing something you wish they weren't doing
with your money Well he's talking about the National Endowment for Democracy He
says the um but anyway the the it's a cold war
era NGO armed by the CIA and is still being bank uh bankrolled by
the Trump administration So why would we still be funding
uh something that was a cold war era entity well we never cut
anything So So if there's no cold war what are they doing well according to
Benz quote uh they have pivoted completely from countering left-wing
communism to countering right-wing populism bragged about censoring Trump
voices had entire operations to stop Trump from the inside and the fact that
they remain what appears to be almost fully funded is like voluntarily giving
your own government cancer That's a great that's a great fra just a
great uh frame I guess Yeah I I guess you I guess we
should ask why is there an entity that we're funding whose uh seems to be its
mission is to stop the government from functioning That doesn't seem like a
good use of my money Is that what you thought you were paying taxes for to stop the person that you
voted for it's
unbelievable But like I say everything that can be corrupt it's
corrupt And I guess all these government nos and government entities you know they they didn't seem
to have any kind of audit or control or check on their on their activities So
they're all just corrupt you know Now I'm sure they wouldn't say they're corrupt They would
say we're uh we're making sure that there's no
disinformation but to us it looks corrupt Meanwhile uh remember how Rick
Grenell uh got put in charge of the Kennedy Center and you probably said to
yourself like I did "Oh that's a you know sort of a harmless job He's got
other responsibilities as well." But I always thought well at least that's you
know just sort of a harmless thing being in front of the in charge of the Kennedy Center But it turns
out that according to uh Rick Grenell um
he wants the FBI and the DOJ to investigate what looks like obvious
gigantic financial fraud from whoever was in charge before he got
there So have I mentioned that every place there can be
corruption there's corruption yep So this was yet another place that wasn't
being audited Uh I believe some Democrats were in charge and uh some tens of millions
of dollars look like they're fraudulent And so Grenell is like "All
right bring in the DOJ See what we can do."
Anyway uh apparently the European Union Union
is uh concerned about war potential for war in Europe and uh these blackouts are
kind of freaking out too So they're sort of suggesting that people stockpile
things and get ready for disasters and they're talking about building emergency
sirens and crisis shelters and telling everybody to stock up on
essentials Now here's what I'm worried about Isn't the only risk to the
European Union Russia it's Russia right it's not like
Greenland is going to attack the European continent
So all of these these worries including the blackouts they must think are Russia
related and might be So here's the weird thing Russia has this ability because
they can sell their oil to China that they can be pretty tough with Europe and just grind them down until
they can kind of control Europe But what happens if they
succeeded then Russia would still sort of depend on China So it feels like the
the endgame is that China controls Russia and Russia controls the European
Union because China is such a big customer that if uh if everybody decided not to
buy the oil in Russia Russia would be in real trouble So I feel like China has just the
perfect play for dominating the rest of the world As long as they back Russia
and Russia can stay in business as long as China buys their energy then Russia can do all the bad
things the cyber attacks maybe eventually physical attacks maybe
bribery maybe trying to corrupt other countries So it looks a lot
like maybe China is the power behind the power behind the
power Just a speculation there Meanwhile according to the Gateway
Pundit a notorious Mexican cartel leader who had a million-doll bounty on his
head has been killed Uh he's one of the Sinaloa cartel people So he was uh
killed in a raid on Friday Now whenever I hear anybody in the
cartel who is a leader being killed in a raid and by the way he was he was in the
fentinel distribution business so we're glad he's gone But don't you wonder if
that's real don't you wonder if really just the army was working for the other faction
because the I guess the Sinaloa cartel was in a pitched battle with
another rival cartel and uh the so I guess 1,200
people have been killed in these rival factions So do you really think it was
the government that got him and and I wonder if we're working with both
sides Are are we saying "All right I'll tell you what If you tell us where the
leaders of the other cartel are we'll kill them for you." And then you go to the other cartel and you say "If you
tell us where the leaders of the other cartel are we'll go kill them for you."
So I feel like it would be a good strategy if we got the the two rival
cartels to be narcing on each other and acting like it's it's the best way to
get rid of the rivals So I do wonder what's going on there I don't I don't feel like we're
ever going to hear the truth when it comes to cartel stuff All right it's a weird Sunday The
news is weird That's all I got for today And uh
I'm going to say hi to the uh locals people privately Uh we're going to do an extra
sip with them And the rest of you thanks for joining And it looks like the troll
went away Thank you And uh we'll see you again tomorrow Same time same place And
locals hang on a minute
