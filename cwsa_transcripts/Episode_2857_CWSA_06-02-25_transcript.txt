Uh, take a look at
stocks. Stocks not so
good. Not so good. So, let's not think
about
stocks and
instead Come on,
Scott. I can make this
work. Come
on. There we
go. Perfection.
If it seems like I have a little bit
more light than
normal, one of my shades is
broken. So, I'm all lit up, so to
speak. I guess I should get my
microphone better with It's better with
the microphone, right?
All
right, good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human
civilization. It's called Coffee with
Scott Adams and I'm pretty sure you've
never had a better time. But if you'd
like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains, all
you need for that is a copper margar
glass, a tanker shell through a canteen
jugger flask, a vessel of any kind. Fill
it with your favorite liquid. I like
coffee. And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine of
the day. The thing that makes everything
better. It's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens
now. All right, that's that's some good
stuff. So, I wonder if there's any
science that they could have skipped and
just asked me. Well, here we go.
According to Sai Post uh over in China,
they studied some pingpong players and
they found that if they kept the
pingpong players awake for 36 hours in a
row and gave them sleep
deprivation, guess what
happened? Do you think they were better
at
pingpong? No. No. It turns out they were
worse.
Did you really need to study if pingpong
players would be better or worse with
sleep
deprivation? Couldn't you do that with
literally
everything? I wonder if they got uh new
funding. They got a new grant. All
right. Now, we're going to test
tennis. Yes. If you do not if you do not
sleep for 36 hours, you will not be that
good at tennis. compared to your
baseline. So, next time, just ask
me. Um, Elon Musk announced
today that uh apparently you can make
audio and video calls without a phone
number across all X
platforms, but I can't figure out how to
do it. Do any of you have a uh a new
button where you can call people on
X? Because I looked for the button and
found none. So maybe that's getting
rolled out a little bit at a
time. Now, how many of you saw the uh
new video of Bigfoot?
So, the latest video of Bigfoot
uh is a guy with a
shirt. If there's one Oh, it's
chat. It's chat. People are saying I
didn't see anything called chat.
But anyway,
uh, if there's one thing I know about
Bigfoot, you know, I'm not I'm not some
kind of like Bigfoot expert or anything,
but there's one thing I know about
Bigfoot. He doesn't wear a
shirt. So, so if you see a Bigfoot with
a shirt, probably not the real
one. That's just my tip.
Well, according to uh wonderful
engineering,
um they've got an aircraft motor that's
so quiet you wouldn't even hear it. Um
at the moment it's for smaller planes,
ultra lights. But if you live where I
live, how many of you live where there's
always plane pollution
noise? I live pretty close to an
airport. So there's pretty much airplane
noise all the time and I don't even hear
like traffic noise because there's not
that much traffic but I hear airplanes
all day
long and
uh wouldn't it be good if you didn't
have to hear Well maybe. So, it's a
company called uh Whisper
Arrow, and uh they're testing it out
now. Well, Joel Pollock, Breitbart News,
is calling out CNN and BBC for running a
unverified claim that Israel killed
Palestinians at aid site. Apparently,
there is no evidence for that
whatsoever. But it didn't stop CNN and
BBC from running with it, running with
the fake
news.
Um,
anyway,
sorry, I got a little bit of allergies
this morning.
So, uh, President Trump is, uh, rolling
out a new task
force to look into,
uh, California's, uh, wasting of money
for, uh, the homeless. So apparently
California spent more than $24
billion over five
years. And I don't think anybody knows
where any of that money went. $24
billion. Where do you think that even
went? Because it's not like they bought
tents. I I don't know what that's for.
But uh Trump is going to get a little
task force according to
RSBN and uh US Attorney Bill
Sly is going to be in charge of
that. This one's kind of fun because
don't you assume there's a 100% chance
that there's going to be massive fraud
discovered and then we're going to find
out how California actually
works. I I think California is just a
money laundering criminal enterprise. I
think all of the mayors and maybe higher
than that are
corrupt and I think that they uh give
out contracts to people that are friends
of them and they get a
kickback and it feels to me like a state
government is literally just a RICO, you
know, just this big criminal enterprise
and everybody knows it.
So that's what I think. Well, according
to Rick Moran and PJ Media, Jake
Tapper's book original sin is not really
selling as well as he hoped. So if you
want to compare that,
um I guess if you compared it to Bob
Woodward's book, Fear, Trump in the
White House, that one sold more than a
million copies in the first week.
But I think uh Tapper's book sold
50,000. So 50,000 versus a
million. That's a pretty big difference.
Now, what could account for that
difference? Well, they could have asked
Scott because here here's a lesson I
learned the hard way. When I wrote the
book, The Dilbert Principle, it was a
number one bestseller because it said,
"Your boss is stupid, but you, the
reader, are
smart." That's how you sell a book. So
when Bob Woodward wrote fear Trump in
the White House, then all the people who
were afraid of Trump, they would read it
and they would say, "Oh, I'm as smart as
Bob Woodward. He just knows a few more
things than I know, so he's rounding out
my knowledge."
So if if somebody sells a book that's
trying to tell you what you already
know, but they say it better and they
add some details, that's going to be a
bestseller. The book that nobody wants
is you were an idiot and all the people
you trusted were
liars. And that's what the tapper book
is because it starts with um you know if
you were a little bit
smarter as a Democrat you would have
noticed that Biden was you know mentally
incompetent and maybe you should have
done something about it as a voter. So
it's basically an insult to voters
indirectly and it's a condemnation of
who they
believed. So not only do the voters get
to feel bad about themselves, it's like
why did I do something about this? Uh
but they they feel bad about the people
whose job it is to tell them what's
real, the news and and the Democratic
party. So, if you had come to me and
said,
"Scott, which of these two books will
sell more? Bob Woodwards of Fear Trump
in the White House
or Original Sin, which is all about
everybody was a Democrat, being
incompetent and not noticing the
obvious." Definitely the Woodward book I
would have picked.
So, that's your uh author um persuasion
lesson for the day. If you're an author,
you want to write what people already
think, but you want to write it better
than they're thinking it. That that's
the trick.
Anyway, according to uh Sai post,
uh playing the game Fortnite is linked
to stronger peer relationships and boys.
So, apparently if you play that specific
game, uh you actually strengthen your uh
social skills and your peer
relationships. But uh that's not true of
every video game. So, some games like
um well, Clash of Clans was also good.
So, Fortnite and Clash of Clans, I I've
never played either of them, but if you
played Mortal
Kombat, you would just get more
aggressive. I guess I would have known
that.
If you're playing a game where basically
you're just ripping somebody apart
without any
friends, it seems like you would just
get more
aggressive. Yeah. Anyway, so
um I'm not surprised by that that boys
actually uh strengthen their their peer
relationships through video games. I've
noticed it. Haven't you? Have you seen
people who play games a lot and you see
that they seem to have a sort of a
strong
social network? It's usually online,
but and often uh I used to watch my
stepson come home and he would get on,
you know, get on the Xbox and he'd be
playing with all of his friends from
school. So, I always thought that was
kind of social.
Well, Bill Maher and Dave David Mamemoth
were in uh Bill Maher's what's it
called? Club
Random. And uh Bill Maher still has this
this hoax he has to lose. He still
believes January 6 was an attempted
insurrection and that the problem was uh
Trump for not saying I concede.
But David Mamemoth was not having any of
that.
So, so when Bill Maher was saying uh not
saying talking about Trump, not saying I
can see it caused half the country to
riot and David Mamemoth says you're full
of
because it's ridiculous to imagine
that just because Trump didn't say I
concede that that caused half of the
half of the country to
uh do an
insurrection. Now, as you know, the
January 6 narrative is a hoax. You all
know that,
right? How many of
you know January 6 is just another one
of the big hoaxes? It's like Biden's
brain is good. It's like the Finding
People hoax. It's one of the famous
ones. One of the most famous ones. Now,
what would it take to debunk the January
hoax? It would be pretty
easy. All you would have to do is bring
in a a panel of half a dozen people,
maybe a dozen, and put them in in a
studio, and you'd say, "All right, you
were there on that day and you protested
and you entered the building. Now, don't
talk to the violent ones. You know, the
violent ones are that's a separate
category. But the ones who just showed
up and you ask them, "What was your
intention?" How many of them would say,
"We knew we know we lost the election,
but we were trying to overturn it."
None. And nobody would say
that. And yet, that's the narrative. The
narrative is they all knew they lost and
they tried to overthrow the uh
result. Nothing like that happened. What
did happen is that the result was so out
of uh let's say out of
pattern. the the number of votes that
Biden got were so strange compared to
historical patterns that it looked it
looked obviously rigged. Now, I don't
know that it was rigged, but I can say
for sure that if you looked at just the
numbers and you looked at the the
bellweather
states, I think it's bellweather
counties. If you look at the bellweather
counties and then you looked at the
total number of votes that Biden
got, that's not enough for me to say, I
know it was
rigged, but it's enough for me to say,
"Oh, that looked totally
rigged." And so the people who were
protesting were trying to make sure that
they had not presided over a rigged
election. So, they just wanted a little
time to take another look at that so
they could be sure that it wasn't
rigged. And uh the Nancy Pelosi play,
she just turned it into turned it into
this, you know, one of the greatest
hoaxes of the last 10
years. But it will fall apart. The
January hoax will January 6 hoax will
fall apart.
All right. Did you know that in the Bay
Area where I live that uh there are
licensed psychologists who help you with
um with things like iawasa and
psilocybin and uh other
hallucinogens and they can it's called
integration
therapy
and so if you wanted to try a lucinogen
because you thought it'd be good for
your mental health. You can get a
uh a coaching session with a an expert,
a licensed psychologist who can help you
integrate it. Now I don't know what it
means to integrated because there are
stories of people who
um did iawaska and then their life was
better and they lost all their
inhibitions and all the things that
bothered them. But there are also
stories of people who were
engineers who did Iawaska once for
psilocybin and then decided they didn't
want to be engineers
anymore and they they just quit and I
don't know what they do start a little
forum in the country or something. So
maybe they're happier. So, I'm not
saying it doesn't work, but
uh are you
surprised that IA and psilocybin are
helping
people with their mental health? You
should not be. And the Bay Area is the
uh I guess it's the place where there's
no stigma according to this article I'm
reading. I think it was in the uh Wall
Street Journal.
Um, so isn't for for the uh
techies, you know, if if you lived where
lived, it's like seems like everybody's
on some kind of
hallucinogen. How many of you could say
that? Is it true that where you
live there are lots of people on
hallucinogens? Because here it's it's so
common you don't even talk about it.
No major life decisions for two weeks
after a powerful dose. That's probably a
good
idea. You just got passing out from
DMT. All
right. Well, there's another brutal CNN
poll about Democrats.
Uh just uh s 16% of Americans believe
the DNC has strong
leaders.
16% one
six. That's pretty bad. Um and uh but
Republicans
40% say the Republicans have strong
leaders.
Now, how do if you're a
Republican, how in the world do you say
that Trump is not a strong
leader? Like, isn't that a weird result?
Now, I can understand why people would
say that the Democrats don't have a
strong leader, but how could you
possibly have voted for Trump and not
think he's a strong leader? How how
could you possibly have only
40%. That doesn't make sense to
me. Anyway,
um only
19% think the DNC can get things done,
but 36% think the Republicans can. So,
these are pretty brutal numbers. And
when Hakee Jeff was presented with these
numbers on
CNN, his answer was, "We don't have the
presidency. So if you don't have the
presidency, you can't get anything done.
And nobody thinks you have a strong
leader." But they were kind of talking
about him, weren't
they? Should Shouldn't he be the strong
leader? That's pretty bad.
Um, have you seen have you all seen the
weird tall hair guy on
MSNBC? If I described him, would you
know who he is? So, I don't know what he
is ethnically, maybe Indian. Um, but
he's got this sort of a gray
streed up so it's like a foot above his
head and just creates this like a it
looks like a flame. but without the
red. It's kind of
interesting. I I have to say if you see
him once,
um you're you're definitely going to
remember him. So, it works from that
perspective. But anyway, he was on MSNBC
and he's buying into the uh idea. I
think there was one professor in Boston
who came up with this that the cuts to
USID have already resulted in 300,000
deaths. Now can you even
imagine believing that that already
just 300,000
deaths? I don't think so. I don't think
so. I think he's probably under the idea
that
USID is literally like aid for people
who want food and stuff. There's a
little bit of
that. Oh, Bono Bono said
it.
Uh, all right. No, not not the dandelion
guy. the dandelion guys, he's
different, but I I can't even imagine
believing that
number. Well, the Tinder
app has uh made a change. Um, apparently
you can set it for not showing you any
men who are under six feet
tall. Now, isn't that exactly what
everybody does with it anyway?
Don't
they look at the height and eliminate
everybody under six feet tall? So now
you can just not even ever see anybody
who's who's under six feet
tall. Now, shouldn't that destroy the
app? Because it's just going to
be a bunch of uh women who want tall
guys. And I think the number of tall
guys who are also single and handsome is
like u 7% of the
population. So that 7% are going to have
their own little app. Everybody else is
just going to be invisible on the app.
Anyway, I can't believe Tinder will last
as a business.
I think I think AI will
uh replace all the U dating
apps because once your AI gets to know
you, you can send it out to find
somebody to be compatible with like an
agent. So it' be like a a dating I don't
know consultant or something. So once
your
AI knew, you know, everything about you
from your picture to your height to your
job to your your preferences, couldn't
you send that out and have it talk to
other AIS and and set up a date for you?
So I think that's going to happen. Yeah.
Anyway, um remember I always tell you
that if you know what happened, you
don't know anything. But if you know who
the people are, well then you might
know. So George Stephanopoulos on ABC.
So that's the first
person. How many of you know that George
Stephanopoulos might be the most biased
person in all news? biased toward
Democrats, uh, which would be no
surprise because he he was, you know, he
worked for Clinton,
etc. But he was talking about an article
in The
Atlantic. Do you all know what The
Atlantic
is? It's not
really a genuine magazine. It's more
like a thing that somebody rich keeps in
business so they could write hit pieces
against
um Republicans
basically. And an article was written by
David
from Fru M. Now again does that name
ring the bell? How many of you would
recognize the name David
from? he would not be an unbiased
person, right? So, do you remember what
the wrap-up smear is? Nancy Pelosi
explained it. So,
you you give the story to somebody in
another publication like The Atlantic
and then that gives all the other
networks a reason to talk about it. All
right. Did you see this article in The
Atlantic? Uh David from has this article
in the Atlantic. Can you respond to it?
So this is the sort of thing that should
be looked at as
uh as sketchy business, but
interestingly the topic is Trump's uh
sketchy financial business.
And I guess they they're trying to uh
collect together all of the various
things that they think he's doing that
don't sound quite right. There's like a
a crypto thing and there's a something
about a
pardon and then there's the Qatari
jet and then there's uh you know
something about
donors and I'm thinking to
myself you can't complicate things
because they're trying to do this hit
piece but if they just throw in all
these different things well this one
person went to a
fundraiser. Um, we don't know if they
gave
anything. There's just going to be a
whole bunch of, you know, unrelated
stories
about how somebody did. Anyway, so my
question about uh all of the alleged
Trump um selfish bad behavior where he's
trying to make money for himself.
Is is anybody losing
money? Is Trump making money on the on
the backs of somebody else or is it just
business as
usual? I don't know. If if there's
somebody who's a victim, then maybe I
care about it. If there are no victims
and everything's kind of transparent, I
don't care about it too
much. All right.
Um, apparently the UK is now on war
footing. So, um, Stormer, head out of
the UK, he he says they the UK should
get ready for war
fighting. Um, he's going to put a
billion dollars into AI and cyber
security. He's going to build six new
munition
factories, 12 nuclear attack
submarines, and a bunch of missile
defense systems, air and missile
defense.
So, does the UK know something that we
don't
know? Is Lindsey Graham over there
trying to get everybody all worked up?
Is there a bigger war coming? Cuz I keep
hearing that uh Putin won't be happy
until he conquers all of
Europe. Do you think that's true? Do you
think that Putin wants to conquer all of
Europe? You think
yes? I I think yes if it were free and
easy. But it wouldn't be free and it
wouldn't be easy and there would be, you
know, there would be resistance forever
and Yeah, I don't think you could really
conquer those countries too
easily. Yeah. No, I don't believe it.
I I do think
um Putin wants to conquer the countries
that are sort of adjacent to to
Russia, especially ones that the Soviet
Union has conquered before because it's
going to feel like there's some some
kind of history
there. Anyway, so I worry that the UK
knows something we don't know.
Um and
uh so here's a story out of Mexico. So
the president Claudia Shinebomb
um is uh leading up a new thing which
she says will make uh Mexico the most
democratic country in the world. So
apparently all their judges will be
chosen by the public now. So I guess the
old way they were appointed, but now
they will all be um picked by the the
public. The trouble is that one of the
political parties has a huge
majority which
suggests that one political party is
going to get most of the judges that
would agree with them. And apparently in
Mexico 90% of crimes are unreported or
not even
investigated.
90%. So that's that's about as broken as
you can get for a you know any kind of a
justice system. Um and this is looks
like it'll make it worse. And then
they're also lowering the requirement to
be a judge. You just have to have a law
degree and five years of
experience. So, good luck, Mexico. It
doesn't look like that's going to work.
Fared Zakario on CNN was talking about
that. Well, according to a
uh gentleman on X who says he's
dedicated to revealing government
spending and fraud,
um his name is Aladdin.
He he seems to have found some uh hotel
bills for uh Senator Lindsey Graham and
Richard Blumenthal
uh for a lavish
lavish Kiev
hotel. And if you want to know how much
they allegedly spent, now I don't know
if this is true, by the way, so I can't
I can't guarantee that this story will
hold up. But um according to Aladdin
um on June 1st
uh two big transactions uh happened. One
for over
$400,000. That's a hotel bill, by the
way. And another for over
$400,000. So there were two hotel bills.
They were both both over
$400,000.
Now, I was trying to think, is there any
legitimate reason that it could be that
much? Because maybe they have to book
the entire floor for security reasons.
You know, is there something going
on that requires that much? Doesn't
sound right to me.
So, we might find out that uh Lindsey
Graham and Richard
Blumenthal are getting a little extra
from uh
Ukraine, but I would say that's not uh
that's not
confirmed. I would look for additional
sources before you believe that one.
Um, you probably heard that
uh Ukraine staged a very successful uh
drone
attack very deep into Russia at their
airports and destroyed a bunch of their
bombers.
Now, they still have plenty of bombers
left, so it's not like, you know, it's
not like that's the end of their bombing
runs, but
um if it's
true, this is how they did it. Now, I'm
not positive that this makes sense, but
it but when I first heard that they were
like, you know, thousands of miles into
Moscow, I wondered, can you really send
a drone thousands of miles into Moscow?
Not not Moscow, into Russia, uh
thousands of
miles. And the answer is maybe they
didn't. So, the uh the alleged way they
did it was they had a whole bunch of
drones and they packed them in a uh big
truck and they hired Russians to drive
the trucks because they didn't know what
the cargo was. So, they hired Russians
to drive these big trucks
uh near the airports where they wanted
to attack and then the truck would open
up automatically. I think the the roof
of it and all the drone swarms would
take off and then they would attack the
um they would attack the bombers that
were sitting on the the
tarmac and then the truck itself would
blow up
um would blow up so it would get rid of
the evidence. Do you believe
that? Do you believe that they were so
clever that they planned for a year and
a half to get Russian truck drivers to
drive their swarm of drones into deep
into Russia and then the truck would
open up the top and the drones would
come out. I don't know. It It feels a
little
too a little too
clever. I I don't know how they could
have done it. So, I don't have a
alternate theory, but I'm going to
say that's not the most believable
story. Anyway,
um does it feel like at this point we
should just count up the number of
drones and declare a winner in the war?
Um because whoever has the most drones,
I think Mal said this, whoever has the
most and best drones is going to win
every war at least for a while.
So, don't we know by now who has the
best and most drones? I've got a feeling
that the United States is
probably making some drones that look
like they came out of
Ukraine. So, I suspect that Ukraine is
the the biggest drone making country
around, except maybe China.
Um, but I'll bet they get a lot of
drones from other countries, too, on
under the under the
table.
Anyway, so that's all I got for you
today. It's kind of a kind of a short
day.
Um, China is the largest drone producer.
Yeah, by
far. By far. They're the largest. But,
but we don't know how much the United
States is producing, right? Cuz what if
the US is also producing tons of drones,
but we don't advertise it? Because I
know there's a whole bunch of new drone
factories that have popped up. I think
California has a bunch. There's probably
a bunch in other places,
too. So, all right, ladies and
gentlemen, I'm going to say a few words
privately to the people on locals and
the rest of you. Thanks for joining.
Thanks for catching up. We We have to
wait for Trump to get more busy.
