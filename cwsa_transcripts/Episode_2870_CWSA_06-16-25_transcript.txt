and looks like his stocks are up yay probably because of the G7
let's uh get the comments working and then we got a show for you
looking good [Music]
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to try taking this up to levels that no one can understand with
their tiny shiny human brains well all you need for that is a cup or a
mug or a glass of tank or shelter stein a canteen jug or flask of vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the
unparallel pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip
and it happens now go
sublime
just perfect well I wonder is there any science that could
have been skipped just by asking me well Eric Dolan writing for Scypost he's my
favorite writer lately um according to him a single dose of
psilocybin um can reduce your alcohol consumption
so if you have an alcohol consumption problem they found that one dose of
psilocybin uh caused a long-term reduction pretty
big one reduction in drinking now how could they have done that study
cheaper well given that every time they have a hypothesis
about how it'll improve your mental state or your behavior
it works every time when was the last time you saw a
psilocybin study where they said "Oh we tested it on this and it didn't work."
Apparently it works on everything you tested on so I don't know what else it could do but um if you had asked me does
it reduce your level of drinking i would have said yes
save me a little money um correction or update i'm told that uh
President Trump has offered to pay for the building of the ballroom
is that confirmed i haven't seen it but um in the comments people are telling me
that he's going to pay for it himself do we know how much that's going to cost
what's it cost to build a a ballroom on the White House that sounds really
expensive i don't know you want to take a guess does anybody know i'm gonna
guess um I'm going to guess
$23 million what do you think 23 million just a guess
anyway so uh the no kings rally
or protest whatever you want to call it the no kings protest
um has been hugely successful because there are no kings um at all and
even uh President Trump in a truth social um said that it was successful because
there are no kings uh trying to replace him i think he borrowed my joke but uh it's
a good one apparently there were uh over five
million people according to the organizers of course now what happens if
five million people protest but there's not much violence
and the headlines are about a u a manhunt for a killer and Israel and Iran
are having a war well it's a lot like it didn't happen at all
so here here's my question has there ever been a big protest where there was
no violence and it changed the policy
is that even a thing i feel like even though nobody wants you know violence
especially with your protests if you don't have any violence
or you know breakage or you know mass some kind of disobedience
um I feel like that's not enough to change anything otherwise it's just taking a walk so five million people
took a walk for a thing that didn't need to be done on a nice day
and absolutely nothing is different but they're claiming success
so uh one of the mysteries which maybe isn't a mystery at all is uh why why are
the attendees at these anti-Trump events um almost all senior citizens
and I took a crack at answering that by saying that it's easier to scare them
you can scare old people easier because they feel more vulnerable and they're
also um easier to fool now they also are the main audience for
mainstream news can you imagine what your opinion would
be if you only watched CNN and MSNBC and ABC News
what would your opinion of Trump be well it wouldn't be very positive because you
would just think "Oh it's like Walter Kankite he hasn't lied to us yet."
So I think the fact that you know the senior citizens feel a little more
vulnerable on top of that they're easier to to brainwash and the fact that they
watch the mainstream media they don't watch acts um puts them at a real disadvantage but
they also have you know time on their hands so a nice walk on a June day turned out
to be what five million people wanted and they were lonely and they didn't
have much else going on so did that change anything in the world probably
not but did you know that uh Alex Soros and Uma
Abedine they got uh they got married in the Hamptons
and there were a lot of elite people there the Clintons and and others
breitbart is writing about this now here's uh my question
does that look like the most fake marriage you've ever seen in your life
they They just don't look like they're really a couple and she is 49 I think
right 49 so I'm guessing that they don't plan to have children and I wonder isn't that a
weird kind of a weird problem because normally if you've got billions of
dollars you're controlling you want to have some kind of an heir
but apparently Alex Soros does not need an heir so or it looks like it i I don't
know unless they adopt or something but I'm not going to bet on it
cuz that that wedding looks to me sort of like uh you remember the old
days when a when a royal family would try to marry off their their kid to
another royal family it feels like that so we'll we'll keep an eye on that
um also according to Eric Dolan and Cypost did you know that uh people who believe
in conspiracies uh tend to overrate their cognitive abilities and they also think that
others agree with them so one of the uh the traits
uh of people who believe conspiracies is that they also have a greater degree
of a certainty now have you heard me say that certainty
is the only mistake if you're if you're positive
about a uh you know some kind of conspiracy theory that should tell you
to to check your thinking you might be right but if you're positive
I don't know certainty is sort of a signal for believing
all right um Karen Bass is telling us that uh she went around looking for the
Marines who were allegedly deployed in LA thanks to Trump because of the uh
anti-Trump protests or the anti-ICE protests I guess and uh she said she saw
no Marines and uh didn't see any trouble
so um she she says the local law enforcement has total control which I
think they do now um this is another example of uh
sort of the uh analogy thinking if you said to yourself "Oh this is like
the uh the protests of or what was it the riots of 1992,"
then you would probably be wrong because it's not like that but whenever you
whenever you're influenced by something that you remember such as "Oh it's like the Holocaust," or
"Oh it's like this other riot," or "Oh it's like the civil war
you're probably way off because there you never have two things they're
they're sort of the same oh it's like Neville Chamberlain saying peace in her
time anyway we'll get back to that
well apparently um coffee is uh considered to reduce
your risk of wanting to take your own life whereas energy drinks will increase
your risk of wanting to take your own life and both of them give you energy
so if you had to pick I would pick the coffee
now how many times have I told you there's a study that says that drinking
coffee is good for you and uh silos is
good for you well now put them together then you've got something
all right um and apparently there's a uh a new risk
uh called gas station heroin which I'd never heard before so you ever
go into the um the little like place you buy stuff at the gas station and you see
these little energy shots and they've got some kind of drug in them called
uh I didn't write it down but uh apparently these are addictive and they have
serious side effects so US poison control has been getting a lot of calls
about these so watch out if you uh think you're getting an energy drink from the
gas station maybe not maybe not well the uh manhunt
has ended for the uh suspect who shot four people two of them uh died and it's
uh this is in Minnesota Vance Luther Bolter they found him in a crop field
and he's the one who impersonated a police officer to get access to his
crimes and they got him and it makes me wonder
um what are the odds of being on the run in 2025
and getting away with it i feel like the hardest thing in the world would be to
go on the run so of course I spent some time thinking
about how I would do it have any of you thought "All right if I
were a fugitive from the law what would I do?" And here's my best idea the best
idea is you'd have to have access to a house that was not your own house and
had no tie to you in name so you'd have to get a friend
um or an acquaintance to rent a house that wasn't where you live and then you
go directly to that house and you just have somebody else who lives there who answers the the uh door so if anybody
knocks you just have your confederate answer the door and say "No no I don't
have anybody in my attic." Now I can't think of any other way that you could go
on the run and stay on the run for very long because eventually
facial recognition would get you or something but uh if you if you're ever
on the run from the law you want to you want to make sure you have a second house that's not in your name that's my
advice anyway uh Trump by now should be in
Canada at the G7 and the stock market is up because people are thinking that uh
that will help grease some of the trade deals now you might say to yourself what
kind of you know trade negotiations are going to happen in these little side
meetings at the G7 and the answer is there might be because it's Trump so
some of these deals it sounds like are kind of close you know there might be like one thing they haven't agreed on
yet so that's the sort of thing that you could imagine Trump saying "All right
I'll take you from 37% tariff down to 25 that's my final
offer." So maybe it's entirely possible he'll get some deals closer to done or
done and the uh market is reacting so uh according to Trump
um we have trade deals all we have to do is send a letter and say this is what
you're going to have to pay so that would suggest that the things which are
negotiable have already been negotiated at least for a number of countries the big ones and that we're just waiting to
find out what it is they they agreed on so stocks are up
um Israel is tried to debunk a bunch of uh false reports that are coming out
about the war remember I warned you that because it's a wars situation you can't
really believe much of anything you know you you can believe the big stuff
like Israel really did attack Iran
and you could believe that Iran really responded you could probably believe that the
various generals and and heads of military that they say they killed
probably most of them they did kill but once you get down to a lower level of
detail you you should get really skeptical you know whether whether you like that news
or don't like it you should tell yourself well maybe but you know in the context of war
a lot of stuff is fake i'm not going to tell you what things Israel is debunking
because it wasn't one thing on that list that I ever heard of so it's not like it's not like it's in the major news or
anything but there were a bunch of things that they debunked because it's that kind of situation
now uh I've been listening to all the various opinions about Israel and Iran
and I remind you if you're new to my podcast that uh if it feels like I'm
giving you a moral judgment I'm not um
I'm not giving you an ethical or moral judgment on anything that anybody's doing um and I'm not telling you my
preference um I'm just observing and in some cases
predicting but uh it's not my country and so since
I'm America first um I will care about America and make
opinions on America but when it comes to Israel I will observe and predict
and uh if you see more than that in my comments you might be reading too much
into it okay so I've been watching the various experts if you can call it that talking
about the the odds that Iran really was going to break out
sometime soon and have a nuclear weapon and the argument against it is that
Netanyahu has been saying that they're going to have a nuclear weapon any minute for 40 years
now somebody said 30 years and then somebody corrected him said "Well no
it's actually 40 years." He's been saying the same thing any minute now any
year now and sure enough we've been predicting that Iran would
break out and have that nuclear weapon any minute now now does that tell you
that we didn't have to worry no that would be analogy thinking that
would be saying that whatever is happening now is the same as what has
happened in the past and therefore the past is predictive of what's happening
now no obviously they've mastered the whole
missile situation so they'd have something to put a nuke on obviously
they had uh enriched the uranium to much closer to the level that you need for a
bomb obviously they had lots of nuclear experts some of whom almost certainly
would know how to weaponize that stuff so is there anything about the current
situation that you could learn from 30 years of essentially being wrong that
they're going to break out any minute and the answer is not really you you'd
have to look at the situation you know completely on its own but if
you're looking at the pattern I would say that uh there's a lot of
stuff like AI So if you look at AI for example AI has
been predicted for 40 years but now it's actually here so if you had
used the last 40 years of predicting AI you would predict that we wouldn't have
it but we do and you know maybe you're thinking of fusion
because fusion was always the thing that's going to be here in 10 years but never is
but it does look like fusion is closer than it's ever been
um so there are a number of situations in which you could say the past does
predict the future but you never know which one those are so uh I would worry about that now uh
General Mike Flynn says and he would know more than I would
know about this situation he says that uh it's a psychotic regime Iran and that
they were very close to breaking out and with a uranium enriched warhead
so in his opinion we were just about there
and so here's another one climate change if your model is climate change and
you've watched for 40 years as experts say "Oh any minute the icebergs are all
going to melt and you're going to be underwater." And then it never happens and then you look at Iran you'd say "Oh
it's one of those things where for 40 years we say it's going to happen at any
minute but then it never happens at all." Maybe
um how many of you think that Iran legitimately
knew it would never make a nuclear weapon how many of you think And how many of
you are certain like you're positive they never would have made a nuclear weapon because they
have said that you know the Ayatollah have said um you know we have no
intention of making a nuclear weapon it would be anti-Islamic and blah blah blah
but you can't really trust that so I would say this is one of those
situations where certainty is the only mistake
um you might be right but if you're certain
how could you possibly be certain about that so you have to you have to play the odds
based on uncertainty I think well Wall Street Journal is reporting
that uh Israel has destroyed uh onethird of the Iranian missile launchers those
would be the um the ones that are attacking Israel right now so only onethird of them have
been destroyed that would be about 120 of them
now does that sound like success to you
doesn't sound like success to me and do they have to destroy all of them
because I saw some uh news coverage yesterday um I forget which general it
was but one of the military uh experts was saying that Israel appeared to stop
shooting down the incoming missiles uh was it last night or the night before i
think the night before and the speculation was that Israel was either
for some reason allowing some destruction which I don't think makes sense uh or they were running out of
defensive missiles the kind that are the shield you know that shoot down the incoming missiles do you think that's
possible do you think that Israel is literally running out of defensive missiles and so
is the US maybe because you know Iran had just
hella lots of missiles that's a California term hella but they had hella
missiles do you say that in your state they got hella missiles it's sort of a California
thing so we don't know about that but I would say that uh if they only got a third of
them um that uh that's not exactly a big victory
at least on the missile side they they may have blown up a lot of the stock piles though so that part we don't know
um and then also Wall Street Journal uh according to the UN atomic agency
chief the uh the Iranian nuclear sites are
basically intact because the ones we could get to or the ones Israel could get to with their
weapons um are well fortified so their biggest one at Ford is untouched
basically and apparently a number of the other facilities are untouched so if
their goal was to dismantle the Iranian nuclear facilities
that did not happen and it doesn't look like they're close it looks like mostly
mostly that stuff is untouched so
that's not good um
now here's the uh here's the big question I have at what point did Israel
know that they could not complete the job without the United States being
militarily involved uh does it bother you that Israel may
have launched an attack knowing that they could not succeed at getting rid of
the nuclear facilities in Iran without the US being actively involved in the
attack because that would suggest
that they were confident or at least hopeful that they could
essentially bully or persuade the United States to get militarily involved
because they had gotten us a little bit pregnant so
does that bother you because Israel must have known that they
couldn't get to those nuclear facilities on their own so are they playing us or are they are
they playing a game where if they get halfway in the United States will say
"Oh you know I wish we were not at this point i wasn't in favor of the attack
but now that we're halfway in h I guess it would make more sense to you know
finish the job because what could be more dangerous what could be more dangerous
than destroying much of Iran's military and leadership and then leaving intact
the most dangerous part of their arsenal wouldn't that be the worst case
so and then I asked myself this question why is this situation so movie perfect
like what are the odds of that what are the odds that Israel requires the United
States military to be part of it and we don't want to but on the other hand you
know a lot of people see the argument for it and again I'm not giving you my
argument these are not my preferences i'm just observing and predicting
so what the hell does Trump do
if he if he gets militarily involved that would be very anti- mega
anti-America first but on the other hand can he really leave Iran to reconstitute
and be a 100 times more angry than they were before and by then have cancelled
all their agreements not to build nuclear weapons and then wouldn't they
make a race to complete at least a few weapons wouldn't that be the most um logical
thing for Iran to do so how do we get in this situation that
it's so movie perfect that there's that little wrinkle that only America can
complete the job but we don't want to and then the only thing that's missing
from the movie is that the only person who could pilot the plane to blow up
Fordau is Tom Cruz only Tom Cruz can complete this mission
doesn't it feel like that like it's just it's just way too movie perfect
you know in a bad way not in a good way um so there's that
and uh again I ask when did Israel know that they couldn't complete the job
without us because that bothers me a little bit
there is also news that Trump um
convinced uh Israel not to take out the uh Ayatollah the uh the non-military
leadership now do you believe that remember we're we're in the context of
you know war and all the all the reporting in the war is questionable at best do you think that Israel was going
to take out the supreme leader and Trump talked about it
it's believable it's believable i don't know if it's true but uh and then uh
Brett Bearer asked Netanyahu on an interview he said "Do you have intel that the assassination attempts on Trump
directly were directed from Iran?" And Netanyahu says through proxies yes um
through their intel yes they want to kill him look he's enemy number one and
they said that they tried to kill him as well enemy number two so do you believe
that do you believe that uh Iran tried to
kill Trump twice and that Trump when he got a chance to kill them back
uh cancelled it maybe maybe um
maybe I'm going to I'm going to say that's just a maybe
i'm not automatically going to believe all of that um the the part I believe
the least is that Iran tried to kill Trump that part
that's a tough one maybe but it's it doesn't feel like that would have been
in Iran's best interest so anyway
um the uh Israel's situation is dividing
America as you might imagine but in terms of the elected officials it seems
to be tougher on the Democrats because the Democrats have people who
are all in on uh whatever it is that Israel wants militarily we should do it
and then there are other Democrats who are you know very anti-war and uh think
it would be a big mistake to get involved militarily so the Democrat leadership we're not talking about the
voters just the leadership are divided whereas the Republicans are
um seemingly less divided
but um and that would mean that the Republicans are more in favor of
military support for Israel but um the MAGA supporters from uh I think
Charlie Kirk and maybe Steve Bannon and lots of others are uh and Marjorie
Taylor Green so there are a number of very prominent proTrump people who are
saying absolutely not no way do not get involved you know further than we are
the only involvement now is probably intelligence and helping Israel shoot
down an incoming but uh getting more involved than that would be a big
divider in the world of the you know America first mega world um Medi Hassan
who you know him from I think he got released from MSNBC
but he's a a very lefty lefty kind of guy he said in a uh ex post he said "To
say I'm no fan of Tucker Carlson is an understatement i loathe much of what he
stands for and says but if he helps persuade Trump to keep the US out of a
full-on war with Iran then we'll owe him a great deal of gratitude it kills me to
write this but it's true so Tucker um is also one of the ones who doesn't
want to get us more involved and let me let me read uh Tucker Carlson's opinion
and I'm going to call it a half opinion because I don't think he his opinion
covers the whole situation but he says the real divide isn't between people who
support Israel and people who support Iran or the Palestinians the real divide is between those who casually encourage
violence and those who seek to prevent it between wararm mongers and
peacemakers who are the wararm mongers they would include anyone who's calling
uh Donald Trump today to demand air strikes and other direct US military involvement uh on that list according to
Tucker would be Sean Hannity Mark Leven Rupert Murdoch Ike Pearl Mutter whoever
that is and Miriam Adlesen at some point they will all have to answer for this
but you should know their names now now here's my here's why I call it a
half opinion i think if you have an opinion on this
that you need to be able to draw out what it looks like in both directions
so if you said um I don't want us to get into a you know a deeper military
problem with Iran that totally makes sense if all you're
looking at is the cost so it would cost us a bunch of money we would probably
lose a bunch of lives uh we would have all kinds of you know unknowns in terms
of terrorism coming our way etc so for the half of the opinion that Tucker
expresses he's completely accurate that if we get involved there's a gigantic
risk and it's going to be expensive and all kinds of problems but doesn't he
also have an obligation to draw out what the alternative would look like that
would be the other half of the opinion and the alternative is that you you uh
let's just say injure Iran deeply everything from their ego to taking out
their a lot of their leadership um you destroy a whole bunch of stuff uh
you humiliate them and then you let them reconstitute and then they just build back what they
had are you better off or are they far more
likely to use you know the many more missiles that they make than they have
now and there would be better ones probably and would they more likely race
to complete their nuclear weapon and if they completed it what are the odds they
would use it um and what are the odds they would simply use it to make an
umbrella to protect their proxies in other words their proxies might still do
all the work you know once those are reconstituted as well but uh you
wouldn't want to attack the homeland cuz then they'd have a nuke so does Tucker Carlson's opinion
cover both sides of the risk i would say no doesn't mean he's wrong so remember I'm
not I'm not taking a side i'm just observing and predicting so what's wrong
with this opinion is that it acts like one side is free
that if you get militarily involved that's going to be very expensive and
treasure and lives and it would be but if you if you don't do those things then
it's just sort of free is it is that a uh adult complete reasonable
opinion that if you let Iran reconstitute from this point
having taken as much you know abuse as they have
are you going to be in better shape i don't know marjorie Taylor Green also uh
is very anti-war and uh she says we're finding out who the real American f
first people are um and she thinks we're a bunch of fakes the fakes would be the
ones who are calling for war and I would ask
um Bargerie Taylor Green the following question the same question which is what
does it look like if we don't go to war now again if you're new to me it sounds
like I'm in favor of war i'm not i'm asking the most reasonable question you
could ask which is what happens if you do it and also what happens if you don't
do it so you need to be able to gain both the zentence of the future i would
say if we do it it's going to be a huge mess like we'll probably come under more
attack it'll be very expensive uh we'll think we got all of their facilities but
we won't um we'll never know when we're done uh it will kick off a round of
their attacks on us and then we'll have to attack them back and then we'll be running out of weapons and who knows you
know it'll it'll drain our treasury more so certainly being militarily
uh involved more than we are is going to be really expensive in all the ways we
don't want it to be but what happens if we don't
what happens if we don't if you can't if you can't game that out and say "All
right here's my opinion." Um and I'm not saying this is my opinion i'm just
saying this is what one might say you might say "Well it's been 40 years and
they haven't you know broken out with their nuclear weapons so if they say they're not going to do it maybe we
should just trust them." Do you feel comfortable with that to
just trust him if they say no no seriously we're not going to because it
seems to me that all that uh that refining of the fuel
why would they need to do that unless they were planning to get as close as possible to break out you know it it
seems to me that Iran was acting exactly like a country that wanted to break out
or at least have the ability to break out whenever they wanted to so
if they go back to where they were aren't they going to try even harder
to break out sooner i don't know
but um beware of half benignions so as I
was saying before that how you feel about the Iran situation probably has a
lot to do with which analogy is running your brain
because we're not really good at thinking things through from you know first principles and you know if this
happens that would happen if this happens that would happen we tend to snap the grid meaning if there's some
some um historical example that it reminds you of you're going to
automatically think that it will turn out the same way so if your model is
Neville Chamberlain saying that uh he's got a deal with Hitler only to find out that Hitler
didn't mean it and there was no peace in our time then you would say "Oh we
better get involved in helping Israel because we don't want to be like Neville
Chamberlain who just you know naively expected the evil the evil other side to
you know want peace or if you're thinking about the Holocaust
if that's your primary model that's running in your brain and I would imagine that for a lot of the Jewish um
Americans and Israeli Jews that would be primary thing running through their mind
then you look at the the Iranian um leadership saying they want to
exterminate Israel and you say to yourself well that reminds me of the
Holocaust so never again and you know Netanyahu said
that directly he said this this is never again
so if your analogy that's running in your head is the Holocaust then you
probably are in favor of direct US military intervention when
in theory it would be the easiest to do now than it will ever be
but suppose you're thinking of Libya or Iraq
uh two countries that got destroyed and maybe there wasn't a good reason for either one of them being destroyed then
you would say to yourself "My god we cannot be involved with you know destroying yet another country
um just because our military-industrial complex wants to sell more weapons." So
if that's the analogy that's running around your head then you're thinking "Well maybe maybe not get more
involved." But you you see my point right
you don't see a lot of people saying let's reason this through in in all the
paths all right if we take this path the most likely outcome is this and then
that will lead to this and that will lead to that no mostly we just snap the
grid and say "All right I think more about the Holocaust than I think about Neville Chamberlain."
And and then that's your that's what you think is your opinion and that if we
have a certainty about it well that's a real signal that you're not doing it right right we we should be looking at
it as you know a riskreward with a certain percentage risk in either
direction so certainty is a bad sign
um in other news uh apparently uh Trump has said that he
wants to expand im the uh deportations into
um the power centers of the Democrats the power centers being uh LA Chicago
and New York and I think Trump is saying directly now that because so many
immigrants were brought in um to maybe increase the uh political base of the
Democrats that he wants to go after that political base that they're building and
uh get rid of it or decrease it as much as possible so uh a lot of Republicans
and I guess now that includes Trump believe that the uh Democrats were
mostly in favor of bringing in new voters and if not new voters then at
least new residents that get picked up by the census and then it determines how
many how many representatives your state gets so Trump seems to be deciding to
directly go against that and try to ship back as many people as possible from the
places where it would make a difference to representation now where does worst first
come in this it seems to me that Trump is now
abandoning the get rid of the worst first and he's going after get rid of
the most people you can cuz I think Stephen Miller wanted to get up to 3,000
a day i think we're closer to a thousand a day
so to get from a thousand a day or whatever it is it might be hundreds to
3,000 you're not really going to be able to do that with the worst first because you're
not going to be able to you know process that many criminals or at least you know
here here's where I have to stop and say "Oh yes I know they're all criminals
because they came in illegally but you know exactly what I mean so don't be an NPC and say "But Scott but Scott they're
all criminals they're all criminals Scott." We all know that
everybody in the conversation knows that they're technically criminals
because they came into the country illegally but you also know that whenever we talk about the criminal
versions of them we're talking about extra you know extra crimes on top of that so you know don't be an NPC you
don't need to remind me that they're all criminals technically
we got it we got it anyway so um it looks like Trump thinks he has the
political support to go deeper and uh
we'll see i I hope it doesn't get uh I hope there are not any uh let's say
unintended consequences that come out of that but we'll see according to uh a
post I saw by Wall Street Apes on X the uh Los Angeles mall which would be a
high-end mall you know with jewelry shops and nice places like that is totally boarded up
every every store in the mall the the windows are covered with boards now I
assume that's mostly because of the recent protests but it makes you wonder
if they're going to keep that up i I feel like the whole idea of shopping in
person at your local store is if it's not already dead
it's kind of on the way to being dead because the looters are not going to
leave stores alone i mean apparently looting is pretty popular so given that
you can buy almost anything through the mail and the fact that you're not going
to want to go to a store that's boarded up even if it's open you know it's going to be creepy to go to a store that's
boarded up all the windows um it feels like in-person shopping
is just on the verge of being extinct you know maybe for stuff like you know
Target or something it might remain but it's hard for me to see an upscale store
that has stuff that's easy to loot and steal like jewelry it's hard to hard for
me to imagine there will still be jewelry stores in malls in 5 years
i don't know just seems unlikely well uh Lindsey Graham is in favor of uh
more sanctions on Russia he thinks that'll make a difference um
he says if they don't have a breakthrough soon in negotiations that
he'll put these gnarly sanctions on Russia and that th those will easily
move through the Senate and the House i don't know about that what do you think
i I'm having trouble believing that there are sanctions we could have put on
Russia that would make a difference that we haven't used
is anybody even clear what that would be like some of it is against the oligarchs
but that never moves the needle um and some of it would be I guess
against our allies who are buying fuel from Russia
so we'd basically be sanctioning our own allies wouldn't we
um so I don't even know what that those sanctions look like but apparently
Lindsey Graham is aware of some unused sanctions
i I wouldn't uh make a big bet that that's going to work out
well according to ex user Nick Cruz Pain who talks about Tesla stuff he he says
the Grock integration is going to be coming to the Tesla UI soon it could be
a gamecher and to me that does seem like
a gamecher because it's one thing to get into your self-driving car and have to
you know program it on your screen it's another thing to get into your car and say um take me home
or get in your car and say "Take me to the grocery store." And you don't even
know where it is but it says "Which one?" The one that's close and you go "Yeah that's the one." Imagine talking
to your car oh according to leading report a million
illegals have self-deported under Trump hm i don't know if that's true how would
we know um I guess if they self-deported through the process that Christy Gnome
is promoting where you use the the app on your phone to self-deport
maybe maybe maybe a million have have left maybe but anyway the uh Tesla with
AI that you could talk to the entire time that would be amazing i mean that
would be such a different experience just you know as long as no one else is in the car
it It's probably no good if someone else is in the car but if someone else if no one else is in the car you could tell
your you could tell your uh car to give you a tour of a historic area and then
the AI could describe the historic area as you drive through i mean how cool
would that be very cool and you could tell it was stuff like "All right uh I
like to eat lunch around 11:30 so we're going to go here um so plan me
a lunch and make me a lunch reservation." Um and make sure there's a place I can
charge my car and you know then you're having some fun
all right um I think this is real that
uh Trump has announced plans to launch a wireless brand Trump mobile
so there will be a Trump phone and I don't know if they'll make a phone
but a Trump mobile phone service now I always wondered because there are a
number of uh uh what would you call it second tier mobile phone uh providers who don't own
a network and somehow they I guess they rent time
on the existing networks but they offer their own phone service is it Mint is
that one of them and I don't know exactly how those work but I assume
that uh Trump mobile if it's real um would use facilities that are already
built i doubt I doubt he'd be building out his own network but maybe it seems
unlikely uh it's the wholesale side of telecom yeah
so so that's an interesting idea all right
uh apparently the uh Chinese companies that are trying to get access to our good AI chips uh
are finding it moronically easy to do so our best AI chips um are banned from
China so the AI people in China can't just you know buy some chips and then
use it locally but what they can do and apparently what they are doing is they
they buy a um a data center in Malaysia where it's legal to have all the chips
you want and then they bring a a suitcase full of uh hard drives and they
do all their work they train their AI on this data center with the good chips in
Malaysia and then when it's trained to the new version they load up all their
uh their drives in their suitcase and they take the model that's now trained
back to China so apparently the workaround is moronically easy to do and
is in full in full swing so if you thought we were uh slowing down China by
denying them chips well you know we may have slowed them down by a week because
you have to travel back and forth with your suitcase full of hard drives but we
didn't really slow them down they figured out how to get their data centers in Malaysia and other places I
guess um speaking of AI The Guardian reports
that thousands of UK university students have been caught cheating using AI are
you surprised no so here again I I credit the uh
there's some American uh college I forget which one that is going to say AI
is great use AI for all of your work and knowing how to use AI is important so
just use it for all your classes i think that's the smarter model um but we'll
see but certainly it's going to be a gigantic problem of people cheating
using uh using AI all right ladies and gentlemen that's all I got for you
today i'm going to say a few words privately to the local subscribers and
the rest of you i hope you enjoyed it and you'll come back tomorrow same time same place we'll be here i'll be here
so you'll be here we can sip again all right locals coming at you in 30 seconds
privately the rest of you have a great day
