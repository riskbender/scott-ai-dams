there you are it's about time come on in
come on in yep and welcome
good morning and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time and it's also Father's Day happy Father's Day but
if you'd like to take this experience up to levels that no one can even
understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a cup of
mug glass and candy jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i
like coffee and join me now for the unparallel pleasure the toine hit of the
day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it happens now go
wow so good see if we can get our comments going
and then we've got something all right incredible it's all working
well let's start with the uh big tragic story as you know uh there was a shooting in
Minnesota a uh I guess targeted were uh four lawmakers
so state lawmakers two of them were killed uh two of them were wounded
husband and wife and the uh the man who did it is still at large
and he had a uh a weird mask on that made him look like a bald man
or made him look like me actually uh but he looked like a policeman
somehow he had a police car and a police outfit
and uh he used that as his uh entry for
shooting four people two of them died now of course because we're all bad
people instead of thinking about the victims which we should be thinking about we
think about the politics and most of the news is obsessed with
trying to figure out is he a crazy leftist or a crazy right-wing guy
um I'm going to go on record as saying I don't care
because the damage is done and he's
crazy you know whether he's crazy left or crazy right I'm not really keeping
score that way yeah these are anecdotal um there's something wrong with that one
person and they may or may not have a coherent set of ideas but trying to
understand them I don't know it's probably not worth it
but um we will look through all of his various indications to try to figure out
is he left or is he right because that would uh I guess that would improve our
our political ical arguments is that what we need to worry about right now improving our political
arguments well he uh he's definitely leaving a
u set of clues that could make you imagine and see it way so I'm not even
going to guess if he's crazy left or crazy right he's crazy and he's on the
loose so watch out um
what else so yesterday as you know was the no kings events so all over the
country people uh made up signs and they
marched and they said "No kings no kings in the United States." And it worked um
I have to admit I was skeptical at first i was like "Really i mean do they need
to do that is there any benefit from doing that and sure enough I woke up
this morning and there were no kings it worked man you know you you really
don't expect that that things will work that that fast
but one day of uh marching and no kings
none at all so good job millions of people have participated
and did their affirmations and it worked there are no kings today
um ironically there was a big 250th
anniversary of the army military parade um what was it that the military did 250
years ago oh yeah they got rid of our king
so they had a no king march that was
opposing the military parade which was a celebration of the military getting rid
of the king so if there's one thing we can all agree on it's no kings
it's the weirdest thing you know if if the worst thing you have to worry about
is that uh both the left and the right are adamant about having no kings well
we're not doing too poorly so we got that going on um the no kings
protest was very large but apparently it was completely overshadowed by the
tragedy of the uh the four people who were shot
and so it just took it right out of the news basically so probably half of the
energy got sucked up into a different news story sadly
um but on top of that it was the war in Iran so you know if you're if you were
planning a protest you picked the wrong weekend
that that was a very noisy you know newsfilled weekend so sorry about that
um I guess uh at the No Kings protest according to the Amuse account some of
them tried to storm the LA ICE facility yeah where was that in Portland
that didn't work out so it was mostly under control
all right it was the They say it's the biggest uh single day anti-Trump protest
during the second administration well it doesn't matter how big it is it
matters how much publicity it gets and it didn't do well on the publicity
so I watched a little bit of the military parade um I had a comment that
I thought was just me until I saw a bunch of other people on social media
did it seem to you like the marching was especially ragged
you know it it's not like uh it's not like I should be criticizing anybody in
the military but did anybody have that same impression like I I feel like they could marshall a
little bit better than that well I don't know what that was all about but it was a robot dog or two so it's the first
military parade with robot dogs um I like the voice over guy
so the parade would have been super boring except there was a voice over guy
and I assume you could hear him at the event or not just on TV but he was uh
giving context you know this uh this unit of historical
soldiers did this or that this unit did that that was kind of made it kind of
interesting um MSNBC
of course had to cover it but they wanted to make something negative of it
so here's how our MSNBC tried to spin a military parade that was
celebrating the same military that got rid of our king
and has protected us all these years and uh they decided that the way to cover it
was to claim that they can read Trump's mind
so MSNBC was this whole mind readader thing we have read his mind and we have
determined that Trump is not honoring the military
no because they read his mind there there's no outward indication you know
outwardly it looks like he's honoring the military because every single
outward symbol and all of his history and all of everything we know about him
suggests he's honoring the military so MSNBC read his mind and determined that
really what he was doing was uh displaying a show of force to intimidate
his political rivals did anybody pick up on that was anybody
watching the military parade and saying "Oh his his political rivals are going
to be afraid of these people dressed in uh Revolutionary War outfits carrying
musketss." Um so that was that was a little bit crazy then uh
then also in MSNBC they tried to tie the uh the military parade to Trump
pardoning violent January sixers and the normalization of political violence
all right did anybody get that so apparently the instead of honoring
the military uh MSNBC thought it was normalizing
political violence they had to reach pretty deep for that
one um and then there was uh
uh who escalate violent rhetoric so yeah they're worried about violent rhetoric
and then Jen Saki uh Jen Saki to the uh the ultimate crazy
crazy lady take she said uh that what was really in Trump's head was not
honoring the military but it was his own birthday party and that the
and that the coincidence it was the 250th anniversary
uh of the military of the army I guess um that that was a coincidence but what
was really in Trump's head was throwing himself a birthday party
now is it is it my imagination that that's not just a a bad take i mean
that's just that's just bash you're crazy anyway um and then uh one of the correspondents
uh Veli I think he he said he was surprised that unlike the uh Trump
rallies um that this military parade did not have and they were surprised it did not
have uh a lot of dark malevolent energy
what what world are they living in that that Trump is throwing himself a
birthday party to intimidate his uh rivals and uh he left out the dark
malevolent energy this time I guess
boy they had to they had to try really hard and failed um well as uh Megie
Emway pointed out in a post on X she said "Whatever is aailing the Democrats
I'm pretty sure Democrat senators posting open hatred of the United States Army celebrating its 250th birthday is
not going to help so once again uh Trump has baiten the
Democrats into taking the side of the 20 in 8020 issue how many people are really
like anti the United States having a military
so anyway so John Federman did his Federman thing where he uh bucked the
the common thinking of the Democrats and you know he had an opinion that uh our
Republicans would like he said regardless of your Democrat regardless
of your politics it's appropriate to celebrate the 250 years of sacrifice
dedication and service so Federman was all in on honoring the the army
all right well uh let's talk about Israel and Iran um so once again
um there have been missiles and rockets and bombs exchanged
israel's taking uh some casualties now eight people killed four children 200
injured 35 still missing so that's pretty bad and uh that will probably
continue for some time we don't know how long um but the the back and forth is
underway so we got a number of things to say about that topic uh number one I
made four predictions so you can track me so see what you think about these
four predictions so prediction number one this is just
from me uh there will be no organic popular uprising that removes Iran's
leaders now I'm not saying there won't be a pretend
popular uprising you know maybe some kind of organized thing that got
organized by the US or Israel or something um but I just don't believe the
population of Iran is in the mood to gather on the streets and do a big
protest and get rid of their leaders and the reason for that is they're under
attack and I don't think the people under
attack take the side of the attacker and it's the attackers who would like
the um like the leadership to change now I agree that it is very likely that there
are a lot of Iranian citizens who also want the administration to change but
they might not have to do anything about it they're probably saying if I just wait
it might take care of itself if you know what I mean so I don't think the uh I wouldn't wait
for the the public in Iran to join the uprising i think they'll sit down
um number two Iran will not return to the negotiating table and give up its
nuclear ambitions but the latest says that uh Iran is
actually asking uh about returning to the negotiating table
however uh even if they do return to the table um I believe that they would only stall
and that it would be a tactic i do not believe they would return to the table and legitimately
say you know what we were really wrong about this nuclear stuff we give it all
up uh let's immediately blah blah now the reason for that is that they are
publicly asking for negotiations but what they're not saying is that they
would be now willing to give up the the one and only thing that was the sticking point which was the nuclear program if
they really wanted to stop the bombing and they really planned to give up their
nuclear ambitions all they'd have to do is say "Hey let's go back to the
negotiating table and we'll talk about our our nuclear program it's now in
play." All they'd have to do is say it's on the table and that we could talk about it
and then it would look different but they don't say that so I'm going to say that they will just never give up their
nuclear ambitions um number three I predict that that
Israel will not stop attacking until they've achieved everything they want
now that leaves a little wiggle room because you and I can disagree on what
it is they want do they want to change the regime leadership
or do they want to simply destroy the current uh nuclear program and go home
or do they want to destroy the missile program ballistic missile program plus
the nuclear and go home or do they want to destroy
Iran's ability to make any kind of military action anywhere or do they want to control the country
with puppets so we don't know what they want but I can tell you for sure they're not going
to go home until they get it whatever it is they want um they do not seem in the
mood to go halfway there it's just not the halfway
administration it's sort of the if we're going to do this we're going to do it
all the way and number four I believe that Israel's prediction that it would
be done in two weeks um is not accurate i believe they will
not not be done in two weeks i don't know if it'll take a month or two months or longer but I don't know how they
could be done done just seems hard
anyway apparently Elon Musk has activated Starlink in Iran because they
lost their uh they lost their internet and I guess we're thinking that the
public would be more organized against the the leadership if they had the
internet but again I'm predicting that there will not be a massive organic
popular uprising we shall see
um apparently now Israel is saying that uh
US involvement would be necessary to do what they need to do now given that I
already said they're they're not going to be done until they get everything they want so what is it exactly that
only the American U interaction could solve is it the
bunker busting or is it much more than that
because if they if they had only said there's just one thing we need you know
we just need to bunker bust these two bunkers then that would be limited and that we
could argue whether that's a terrible idea or a great idea but we know what it
was but apparently Israel is just saying that US involvement is necessary
so what exactly would that be well Scott Jennings happens to be over there and he
issued this opinion from Israel um he said that Trump would be justified in
taking out the Fordo nuclear enrichment facility it would be a righteous
decision would it according to who and if he doesn't no question in my mind
that he would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize well I'm going to make another
prediction you don't get the Nobel Peace Prize by dropping a bunker buster bomb
on your enemies you know even if you think you deserved
it that is not how you get a peace prize uh avoiding a bomb might get you a peace
prize anyway um apparently according to the
Times of Israel uh Trump recently told Netanyahu that
the US would consider striking uh that Fordo nuclear facility which would
require some bunker busing um if it were necessary to prevent tan from requiring
a nuclear weapon now this is in the times of Israel so one source
um so we'll see now as I uh the logish message on X from
investor Bill Aman who's uh getting more involved in sort of international and
national politics and he's always he's always interesting because he's got
wellthoughtout opinions but he's got this uh He's got an opinion on finishing
the job in terms of Israel finishing the job and
he says um we should not let this opportunity
pass uh Israel doesn't have the equipment and arminist to complete the job but we do
and it does not require boots in the ground um it goes so
let's help them finish the job finish the job
what do you think that would look like so let me let me just sort of uh tweak
your imagination so imagine if you will that the US helps Israel
uh destroy what's left of the uh nuclear facilities in Iran then what
do we just leave and then then what happens does Iran say
"Oh darn it well we tried to build those nuclear weapons but that didn't work out
so I guess we won't do that again." And that we won't cause any trouble cuz
it might be another war is that what happens that doesn't sound like Iran does it is
it finishing the job when you replace the leadership
because if we replace it it would look like a puppet and if they replace it it
would probably look like more hardliners so what exactly would look like
finishing the job would it require um dominating the country and
essentially owning it forever would it you know like I said the
puppets wouldn't work and the hardliners don't work because they just reconstitute the uh the risk to Israel
so if you can't define what finishing the job looks like and
you know maybe some people have a specific idea but it's not a not a generally agreed upon idea how can you
how can you operate in that if you don't know what the the end goal should look
like so we got a problem which is if we don't do anything
uh things could eventually get worse because they'll they'll be looking for revenge no matter how many years it
takes them to reconstitute some kind of threat and it might be a different threat you know maybe it's not nuclear
next time maybe it's drones and god knows what loaded onto the drones so
so it seems to me that no matter what we do we we leave them wounded and really
really mad don't they just come back worse than
before i don't know so I'm I'm looking for a better idea than the ones that are out
there because to me it looks like every path leads to Iran reconstituting their
threat whether it's 5 years from now or 10 years from now so I don't know i
don't know what finish looks like um Israel has vowed that quote we have more
surprises coming for Iran so Fox News is reporting that um
apparently Iran was projected to have 8,000 ballistic missiles within two years they
apparently have 2,000 i guess the ballistic missiles are the ones that are hard to stop and carry the biggest
payloads um so I'll ask the same question
if we destroyed all of their ballistic missiles and all of their nuclear
facilities how long would it take them to rebuild at least the manufacturing for more
ballistic missiles because isn't that stuff you can you
know you can slap together i mean not a slap together but if if you already know
how to make ballistic missiles you it seems to me that it would be
maybe one year it would take to rebuild the manufacturing to build them again
and then you make a 100,000 next time so what does it mean
to finish off or finish the job anyway
um we're surprises coming we'll see what that is um
so like I said Iran Iran has uh apparently tried to reach the United
States through Oman and Qatar to mediate with Washington which
suggests that we don't have any kind of direct communication with Iran which is weird
do we really have no direct communication or is it because all of their leadership
is in a don't communicate mode because then we can find them more easily
so it might be that they have to be so careful about how they communicate that
even if they could pick up the phone and just call Washington they can't pick up the phone and just call Washington
because they would get bombed within a minute and a half so it could be that they just have to go through these this
weirdous route just so we can't track who it is who who's even giving the instructions
so anyway so I don't I don't think uh Iran
is 100% serious about negotiating but they might act like they are
um so I guess the prime minister of Cyprus says Iran has asked them to convey a
message to Israel and really that's the only way they can
get to Israel is through Cyprus i don't know seems like they would have
some kind of a email or something it seems at the very least they should
be able to email Israel um so uh Trump is reinforcing on his truth
social that the US had nothing to do with the attack now I don't know do you
believe that do you believe we had nothing to do with it
that might be that might be uh you know our intent but it seems like we have
such close you know military arrangements with Israel that in every case we'd have some kind of indirect
you know support whether we intended it that way or not anyway he says the US
had nothing to do with the attacks in Iran tonight if we are attacked in any way um blah blah blah bad things will
happen so there's that um according to a uh expost on Vizyrad
24 uh Israel destroyed the Shiraz
electronics industry plant that's the only place that uh no the largest
producer of rad radar systems in Iran now if if Israel is targeting
radar manufacturing plants in Iran
um does that mean they're running out of better targets because that would be you know obviously
I understand why they'd want to take down a radar manufacturing plant but it
wouldn't be on the top rung of targets would it because it's not an immediate
thing does that mean that they've already taken out all of the top level
like top priority targets everything that could shoot today or do
radar today are they just makes you wonder did they get everything that's a
higher priority and now they're down to manufacturing plants even though I
understand you know why they would want to target it so that's a little hint
that maybe maybe Israel got more than we thought
um of course there is always the subplot with any kind of um whenever Israel is
involved in any kind of military action there's a subplot about which side is
targeting the more civilians so Iran is apparently um just
indiscriminately targeting civilian areas israel is doing their usual thing
which is trying hard to hit military targets and avoid
um civilian stuff but of course it's a war so civilians will inevitably
you know be hurt um and one of my questions is how accurate
are Iran's missiles and drones can we say for sure that every time they
hit an apartment building they aimed for it or are they aiming for the city and
they're lucky if they hit anything now in either case you could argue that
they're targeting civilians because they're not trying to miss civilians
but it matters a little bit if they have any control
so I'm thinking the ballistic missiles probably are kind of accurate and maybe
the drones are accurate but smaller payloads
so I'm kind of curious about how much they can control in in either case it's
it's all bad and evil and it's war but that's always a sublot who who is uh
worse on going after um civilians
now Tim Walls um made a provocative statement at some event he said that uh
maybe China will be seen as the only moral authority that would be uh able to
uh talk peace with both Israel and Iran now of course we're all you know that's
a uh red meat for the media um China being a moral authority now I don't
think any of us believe that China is morally superior to anyone else
uh but it might be true that China has
not tried to make Israel or Iran an enemy now from that point of view uh if he
would take out the moral part and just say from a practical perspective it
might be that China might be exactly the kind of energy that
you know because it's not an enemy of either of either of them
maybe they can do something productive we'll see but uh whenever I see Tim Wals
say anything positive about China it makes me think about all the times he's
visited and it makes me think I don't think that China encourages that
many visits unless they're working that guy you know trying to turn that guy
into a an asset and that doesn't mean he got flipped and he's any kind of a spy
although you never know but uh you know I have no evidence he's a spy
but then you know he just slips in a little thing about China having the
moral authority to handle this big problem and it makes you wonder how much
brainwashing did he get in all those many trips to China because this looks a
little brainwashy you know like like China accomplished their goal of brainwashing Tim Walsh
because he had enough trips over there you know if you do how many trips they
do like 30 30 trips with uh students and
stuff i don't know looks a little bit brainwashy
well I guess uh Trump and Vladimir Putin had a one-hour conversation by phone on
Saturday according to Just the News and uh the the outcome of their one-hour
conversation is that they both agree the war with Israel and Iran should end uh
and then Trump says he feels as I do this war in Israel and Iran should end
to which I explained his war should also end so apparently they wasted an hour
what was the point of that conversation what was one of them going to say "Oh
we'd like that war to just keep on going." No of course they want the Israel Iran war to be end it doesn't you
know there's no benefit to daddy of us so that was a waste of an hour um but I
think Putin had uh offered to help mediate the situation and again you know
I'm not going to say Putin is a moral moral authority but as far as I know
Putin has a good relationship with both Israel and Iran right similar to China
so maybe maybe he can help and uh Putin
is talking about getting back to the negotiating table with Ukraine
i don't know if he means that it's hard to know if he's serious about that but
he said it so maybe we'll see um AOC
is uh going hard at the uh the elders in her party
and she said this recently about the older established people in the Democratic party she says it doesn't
matter how much you work with them they still will choose their old friends and
and old generation every single time so David Hog going after those older
ones and AOC now going after the older ones um I don't think you'll see Bernie
Sanders go after the older ones cuz he is one of the older ones so that's a
little awkward little bit awkward aoc uh because it does seem like Bernie is
one of the old ones but not one of the old uh uh he's not one of the old
network though it would be outside the network all right but uh it doesn't look like
the Democrats have a good plan to uh come together and beat the Republicans
it looks like they have a plan to fight with each other and maybe that will make them stronger we'll see
um so Trump is already in uh Canada I
believe for the G7 where the the big seven economies get together and uh it's
sort of awkward because uh he he's there on the same
weekend as the no kings event and uh Canada has a king
so Canada wanted to get in on this no kings thing but they realized they have
a king which is hilarious to me so they had to
change it to no tyrants so yeah good luck there
so yeah Trump's in G7 so it's also awkward because he wants to uh you know
absorb Canada and the United States but I think uh I think he's over that
awkwardness um according to also just the news
um the uh curfews that have been put in place for LA because there was a lot of
unrest with the anti-ICE protests um apparently the curfews worked so Mayor
Bass put some curfews in effect and uh
it accomplished everything they wanted which was less trouble at night so what
do people say when you do something that works
they always say the same thing why didn't you do it sooner
now that's a kind of a fair question in this case but if the best you have is
why didn't you do it sooner well I don't know i'll take the win you know I I I
hate to be the one who says "Why didn't you do it sooner?" Um but here we are everything good could
have happened sooner so it looks like the anti-ICE demonstrations wound down
um but does that mean they'll just wind right back up again or they or is it
like squeezing the toothpaste and now they just they just uh go later in other
cities i don't know so does anybody think any of these uh alleged anti-Trump protests
are anything but theater none of it looks real or like it would
have any kind of political impact it all looks totally artificial i think maybe
the entire purpose of it is to make other people think they're part of
something important so they'll actually you know vote and act and cry and you
know worry and shake and all that other stuff so most of the protests I think uh are
propaganda and it's to make other people who are watching
think there's more energy to get rid of Trump than there is and have you noticed that the the people
who want to get rid of Trump they only have vague ideas of what it is that
their problem is it's so vague it's like well he's going to steal my democracy
and then they also talk about all the things he's already done to which I think like what
like what he he's done things that the courts have reversed
he's he's tried things that uh you know sometimes the court agrees on
but it doesn't look very authoritarian to me and I I loved his answer to it
that uh he's far from a king because he it's just hard to get anything done
which is a really good good response it is so hard for any president to get
anything done that they're about as far away from being a king as you could possibly be but uh apparently all of the
uh the very worried mentally ill Democrats have been convinced that he's
up to no good and he's stealing their democracy forever
and I I don't know where it's happening i mean there there are definitely things
that um I don't love about what the the administration is doing but it's not
very it's not very dangerous looking it seems all entirely 100% pro-American
America first stuff so we'll see um so
Trump is uh the administration is looking at adding 36 more countries to
the travel ban um how many were there were there a dozen yeah dozen have already been added
but they're looking at 36 more mostly in Africa uh the reasons for the bans are
that the the records from some countries are not dependable so we can't tell what
we're getting and in some cases uh you
know there's in some cases there's a foreign terrorist threat and uh in some cases there are countries
that have a unusual number of visa overseas
so if there's a country where every time somebody comes in legally they don't
leave when it's time to leave then they get on the list so is that uh
authoritarian well like everything else if the uh
court says he can't do it then it won't happen um and if the court says he can do it it
just seems like he's protecting America so you know it's about as authoritarian as
I'd want it to be well apparently according to Newsmax the
administration is also dusting off this very long dormant uh law the Alien
Registration Act uh passed in 1940 which requires anybody who's not a
citizen to register and so it gives the uh administration
one more thing to charge somebody with because if they're here illegally
uh there's a good chance they have not registered i guess it's a misdemeanor and they could have six months in jail
or $1,000 fine and uh they're supposed to register and get uh fingerprinted
and probably just about nobody's done that so it's sort of an add-on just to
make it more uncomfortable to be here illegally so I think the Trump administration admits that the purpose
of it is to essentially you know persuade uh persuade the
undocumented immigrants that's a bad idea to stay
well in completely different news there was a study to show who the best tippers
are by state and California is named now if there's
one thing I'm getting tired of it's that whenever California is in the
news it's always because we suck when was the last time you saw a story
where and then California was at the top of the list better than all the states
it's beating all the states in I don't know education no
so here is a story about the best and worst tippers
can you guess how California is uh handled
yes of course they're the worst tippers californians are the worst tippers and
the best are Delaware so Delaware gave us the uh Biden family
and really good tipping why would California be so bad at
tipping does anybody have any idea is it because of our demographic makeup
because we have a lot of uh a lot of noncitizens
but that wouldn't affect tipping would it i don't know so I guess California
just sucks at everything um BBC reminds us that the uh world
fertility is at dangerous levels basically everywhere but uh they go on
to say that uh the affordability of having children might be the main reason
and that seems right you know you know we spend time trying
to think well why are birth rates going down everywhere and we're thinking oh
it's because testosterone is lower and we're thinking it's because of the news
or because of our devices or whatever but I think it's just money
i I think it's money everywhere i think every country
um that has an affordability problem they they're just having fewer children
it's just cause and effect so how do you fix that
you somehow having children has to become affordable
and I think that daycare is the biggest thing um if you could get rid of the
daycare costs it's not like the kids eat that much but the other thing that uh
that is crazy expensive is if kids are involved in a lot of events like
organizations if you have a kid who's in a sport and they're good at that sport
they're traveling all over the place and you've got to travel and sometimes you
got to spend the night and you've got to outfit them and it's really expensive
so if you were to fix the schools so that you know kids are not being
required to pay for all this extracurricular stuff and you could fix
the daycare which feels like it's fixable with some kind of shared responsibility sort of
thing seems like you could do it then uh maybe you'd fix the uh the uh population
we'll see um I see in the comments we spend 10,000
a year on sports yeah and that's that's probably common if you have few kids in
sports anyway in other news according to interesting
engineering uh there's new passive cooling technology for data centers now you
might say to yourself "Scott what could be less interesting than a new passive
cooling center for data centers?" Well uh one of the things I've been
predicting is that uh you know we're we think we're going to run out of
electricity for AI because AI will require like I don't know a thousand
times more electricity than we we reasonably might have anytime soon but
as I've been telling you um I'll bet you there will be developments that that
reduce the amount of electricity you need and this is one of them now it's uh
it's not that close to being implemented but it'll give you a sense of what's possible
so it's a new fiberbased cooling technology that gives uh well let me start back
here apparently 40% of your electrical costs for a data center is cooling it
40% is just keeping at the right temperature so if you could take that
40% and reduce it to 10%
you would save the equivalent of you know maybe maybe 300 nuclear power
plants i'm making that up but it would be a big difference so don't be
surprised if you see a bunch of breakthroughs that make it easier to run
AI on more um you know more power sensitive equipment and you see ways to
cool um data centers that we never thought of before so I think the uh the need for
the electricity will be falling faster than we build electricity
so that's that's my prediction anyway uh apparently also Newsmax is
saying that ICE is uh largely going to pause its raids on farms and hotels and
restaurants and that's because Trump has agreed that in those industries you've
got a lot of people who have just been working for years and years and they're
additive to the economy and if you got rid of them all at once you'd be in real
trouble so I don't know how many of you agree with that
um but I will tell you from the real world perspective
replacing them would be way harder than you think um you know there there's a reason
that these industries are filled with uh you know nonocumented
workers and it's because it's really hard to fill these jobs with
Americanborn people and again if you ask me why I would say I'm out i'm out i do not
want to be in the conversation about why that is it's just true
if you know anybody who works in these industries uh anybody who works in the farm motel or restaurant industry and if
they do the hiring so they're really close to it ask them if they could staff
their enterprise with Americanborn people if they had to
they couldn't it wouldn't even be a case of well you'd have to train them
they wouldn't even walk in the door again why i don't know i don't know why
and you know I've thought about it a long time but I just don't know why
it's just the truth so I think uh you know Trump will get a lot of push back
for that because there's still a lot of people who say ship back everybody no exceptions
and I understand the argument but there is a realworld
friction that Trump understands and uh if if you think that that part would be
easy it wouldn't be easy you might still think it's worth doing but it would be
massively disruptive to those industries um but again you might prefer that and
that you know I would understand that all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I got for now um I'm going to say a few words
privately to the local subscribers and the rest of you thanks for joining uh
we'll keep an eye on uh the news today see see who else is being a victim
there's always some new victims and uh I'll see everybody uh tomorrow same time
same place I hope come on back tomorrow all right locals private in 30
seconds
