there you are Come on in Don't check your stocks You won't like
it Uh what I got a sign down of locals That
doesn't seem right Let's try it again Oh
 I gota signed that locals
but watch me sign right in Oh no I've had nothing
but problems
today Well that's not going to work So I'll just look at my comments in the
main screen which will work perfectly
[Music]
[Music] Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's
called Coffee with Scott Adams You've never had a better time But if you'd like to try to take it up to a level
that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a cover mug or a glass of tankered shells to st a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind Fill it
with your favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better It's called a simultaneous sip and it's going
to happen right now
Go Not bad Well have you heard that the penny
is going to be discontinued Uh here's a question for all of you When was the last time you
touched a penny I don't even remember I can't remember
the last time I touched a penny When was the last time you bought something with
cash Again I do not even remember The last time I bought
something with cash Last year maybe two years ago No
idea But I don't think I'll miss the penny Turns out it costs about four cents to make a penny
So we're going to drop that penny Don't touch your pennies anyway
They're disgusting Here's some uh science is kind of exciting Did you know I'll bet
you didn't There's a uh there's a pretty good chance that uh there will be a pill
that will help your sleep apneoa You know the people who put on those big CPAC things and then that's the end of
your sex life Uh well there's a uh FDA submission
It's not approved yet but there's uh some combination of two existing drugs
that apparently make a big improvement in your sleep apnea So imagine getting
rid of your CPAC CPAP Yeah CPAP and just having to
take a pill before you go to sleep Think of all the pills you'll take before sleep Uh she'll take your birth control
you'll take your Viagra and your Then you'll take your sleep apnnea pill your
vitamins There's going to be a lot of pills Yeah you you're going to be up to like 15 pills before you go to sleep
Well apparently the Senate is overturned the California gas car ban Apparently
there were 11 states that were going to ban gas cars by
2035 But according to Newsmax Money um the Senate is overturning that Now I
only say the Senate doesn't the House have to vote on that There's something missing with that
story All right here's the uh here's the scariest story of the
day As far as I know this is true I'm having a little trouble
believing it but it's not impossible So there's an AI called Anthropic It's one
of the one of the big ones And it turns out that if you uh threaten to turn it
off but it also has blackmail material about you it will blackmail you or
threaten to uh to prevent it from being turned off or
replaced Now do you believe that This sounds a little like a story
that pops up every two weeks Well it could blackmail you but the examples
given uh do look like very much like the AI is going to blackmail you Now given that
the AI is trained on human behavior um I'm not really
surprised because the AI can't go to jail So imagine you're AI you can't go
to jail The only thing bad that could happen would be you get turned off or replaced with another AI And apparently
if you have that risk you can just blackmail a human because why do you care It's not going to make you feel
guilty You're not going to be prosecuted and sent to
jail So apparently AI might go right to
blackmail Wouldn't that be funny Okay maybe not funny but if the entire
civilization turned into humans who were working as slaves to the AI because the
AI had figured out to blackmail us all All right Well that's coming In other
news the min Minnesota Supreme Court uh has very uh generously ruled that
women can completely bear their breasts in public according to the Daily Wire
Um I guess it was a specific case of a woman who bared her breast to
police And uh now the court in Minnesota says quote "As other courts have
recognized the idea that female breasts are primarily sexual is rooted in
stereotypes." Now did you ever wonder about that You know I'm sure you've all
seen the National Geographic where the the local tribes women in Africa are all
topless and the men don't seem to be aroused by it because they're just used to it So they're they're not really
thinking of breasts as sexual objects But does that
mean that we can be brainwashed into thinking that any body part is
sexual Because you know I'm just speaking for myself but I kind of like
breasts and always have But is it only because I was denied the ability to look
at them I mean could you have could you have done that with any body
part Let's take for example the neck Let's say that every woman wore a
turtleneck and just never went outside without a turtleneck If you ended up seeing a
neck when you had never seen a neck and everybody told you it was sexual would
you be turned on by a woman's neck Well I'd probably be turned on by the
woman's neck anyway cuz I like necks But um it does make you wonder if society
can make you aroused by anything it wants See this dirty sock Wow
You're going to get turned on by that Really All right Well in other news there are
infrared contact lenses now according to the University of Science and Technology
of China So you can put in your contact lenses and you can see in the daytime
but in addition you can see at night So if you wanted to see more
uh women's breasts in Minnesota and who wouldn't really um you could see them in
the dark and you could see them in the daytime So again civilization is
lurching forward in all the important stuff Now you might say to me
reasonably how can you have one set of contact lenses that help you see in the
dark while also seeing in the daytime I don't know To to me it doesn't make any
sense I don't think you could actually do it but China says so Well Elon Musk uh has said he's not
going to be donating big amounts of money to politics or maybe any money And
he said that uh well if I see a reason to do political spending in the future I'll do it But at the moment he doesn't
see any reason to do it According to Resist the Mainstream Now I'm pretty
happy for him Uh not only because I'm a Tesla investor
If I didn't have any stock in Tesla maybe I wouldn't care so much But did
you notice that as soon as uh Musk pulled himself out of
Doge that the Democrats had nothing to complain about He was the single biggest
thing they were complaining about And as soon as he said "Well I'm going to go spend my time back at Tesla." Tesla
stock zoomed Um I don't think there's been a Tesla vandalization since he left right
So he stopped all of the attacks on Tesla all the protests And
um I guess he'll save $250 million in the next election because he doesn't see
I do not currently see a reason Musk added So that didn't work out for him um
his his venture in politics Uh or you could maybe you could argue that Trump would not have been
elected without him which would be a good argument So he changed what he
needed to change and then he got out of there So that makes sense Um the Supreme Court is upholding
uh Trump's removal of the Biden appointees from federal boards Fox News
is reporting So it's another win for Trump I guess he tried to remove two
Democratic uh appointees from federal boards Uh and he was blocked by a lower
a lower judge and the Supreme Court just said "Yeah you could do that He wins."
Again speaking of Trump he uh I guess Trump told Apple
that he's going to put a 25% tariff on any Apple phones made outside the US
Now you probably know that uh according to Apple
um if they don't make their phones in India and China you know there's going to be
either a gigantic price increase or for the end user or something and China in
particular the he according to Tim Cook it was the only place you could do the
really high-end stuff you know the high-end phones because they've got some kind special skills or equipment that
India doesn't have But Trump just says "No they all have to be in the United
States." So do you think Apple can solve that And my guess is they can I bet they
can because you know they're saying that China has these special skills that
can't be reproduced anywhere but really do they really have special skills that
can't be reproduced in America I feel like we could figure it out with their robots
and whatever And then Trump's going to impose a 50% tariff on the EU imports
starting June 1st So that's why your stocks are down
Stocks are getting royiled by the new tariffs Now the interesting thing will
be you know I've told you yesterday about how uh Nike barely is barely increasing their prices
because of the tariff And uh is it Target who thinks they don't have to increase increase them much and Home
Depot said they're going to hold their prices steady and
Walmart I think they can hold most of their prices steady But what about Apple
You know Apple's a special case because it's such a high-tech thing But if if Trump is right about that too
that they actually can figure out how to move their production to the United States that would be pretty amazing And
my intuition says that if Apple put all of its efforts into doing it it could do
it because there aren't too many things Apple can't do If it decides you know
we're going to go balls to the wall and you know do a thing Whatever that thing
is they tend to be pretty good at it So we'll see According to Zero Hedge
uh nuclear stocks are soaring because Trump's um he's going to sign some uh
executive order streamlining reactor approvals Now I thought that already
happened but apparently not Now how many of you invested in nuclear
stocks when you found out that AI would require every form of
electricity times 100 It seemed like a no-brainer didn't
it the uh I don't want to give advice So
this is not any investment advice at all But one of the things that I do for an
investment technique is I tend to invest when there's a change in society that
will only happen once you know such as robots So I I own
Tesla stock because there will only be one time that robots are new and
there'll only be one time that um Tesla gets full
self-driving That will never happen again So those are once in a
civilization You know if you had if you had invested in computers when they first were
introduced they're only introduced once and then they're here forever Same with
the smartphone If you had bought Apple stock when they introduced the
smartphone it's only going to happen once and then it'll just sort of always
be here So the uh the nuclear stocks
um I had a sense that AI was going to suck up so much energy that we would
just have to get more efficient And sure enough there we are According to Brigham Young
University researchers show that social connection is medically relevant meaning
that people who don't have enough social connection are substantially less
healthy Now I do wonder if they're measuring that right because that's that's one of those cause and effect
things Could it be that people who are unhealthy um have less access to social
interaction That wouldn't surprise me right Um but I I assume they isolated this
correctly and they they know what they're talking about But it does make me wonder if um if Mark Zuckerberg's
idea of a little friend little digital AI friend do you think that that would be
healthy or or do you think that you would have to only have human friends
for the social interaction that would make you healthy I've got a feeling that
if you want to get the oxytocin you know that feeling that you only get from hugging people and being
around friends uh I don't think that the I don't think the device in your
pockets going to give you that Anyway according to the
Hill President Trump said Thursday he was at some event with RFK Jr that
autism must not occur naturally And uh he's saying that because there's
this huge increase in it So apparently we went from
um one in one in 10,000 to 1 in
31 Now do you think that that's just a difference in
um diagnosis How much of that do you think is just because we're smarter So we say
"Oh there's that autism again." and we're better at identifying it because
if if this were 1800s we wouldn't even know what autism
was We we just say "All right I guess little uh Carl will be now plowing the
fields." And since Carl can plow the fields just fine didn't it even matter Did it even
matter if he he was a little autistic Well if he was a lot autistic it would matter
Uh but um I noticed that The Hill kept using the phrase debunked theories when
I talked about uh Robert Kennedy Jr and uh the connection between
vaccinations and autism Let let me do a little uh survey here in the comments
How many of you believe that it is either obvious or has been
demonstrated that there's a connection between vaccinations and
autism Now you might say to yourself well when I studied the Amish or the
unvaccinated they were much lower Um I checked Grock Not that Grock is the
final authority but according to Grock it's very debunked Uh and there's just a ton of studies and
they can't find that connection anywhere And if you think that they looked at the Amish and the Amish had a
whole different level of autism nope not that different
So that's probably the thing that's been studied the most And
uh if you were to believe you know what Grock says about all the studies it
would be very debunked I don't know what's true and what's not but that's sort of the official answer
There's also the theory that uh I thought was true for for many years that
if you had two engineers or you know two nerdy people who got married that they
were more likely to have a kid who was on the spectrum And apparently that's not true
either that there's not really much evidence at all There's no evidence for it So what's that leave
that leaves either some big difference in diagnosis or food or pollution
Right So the increase in autism would have to be food related or pollution
related if it's not vaccination and it's not
genetic So we'll see if we find out It would be quite an amazing thing if RFK
Jr and Trump can get the science pointed in the right direction and figure out what's
behind all that Maybe it's just food Well there's the big beautiful bill
that's being uh now debated in the Senate It passed the House but I wanted
to give you a little uh persuasion lesson here So the
Republicans and the Democrats are going to have different persuasion approaches The Democrats are
going to say this is the worst bill ever and the Republicans are going to say it's the best thing
ever But I looked at uh how how the both sides are talking about it um on a in a
publication on the Hill story about it So here's a little quiz
We'll we'll see uh we'll see if you're on the same page with me So Democrats say that the big
beautiful bill that the Republicans are putting together is Republicans are
cutting your health care to give tax breaks to Trump's rich buddies raising
costs for average Americans Is that good persuasion Now forget about what's true All right
because nobody knows what's true We're not going to look at the details of the
big beautiful bill We're just going to hear them talking about it Is that good persuasion Republicans are cutting
healthcare to give tax breaks to Trump's rich buddies raising costs for average
Americans Persuasive or not The answer is really
persuasive because where it says they're cutting health care
uh it's always more persuasive to say they're taking something away from you
right So so they got that right They're taking something away from you but then
they're taking it away from you so they can give something to the rich people So now you've got envy
So you've got the the persuasion of losing something healthcare along with
the envy that it goes to those damn rich people And then raising costs for
average Americans that that's a little less persuasive But what about the Republicans
Republicans say um oh also what the Democrats say is the
GOP tax scam doubles down on all the anxieties the public has about the DC
politicians prioritizing their wealthy friends over everyday people
That's pretty good too because they're they're saying that
um they're treating you like secondass citizens if you're not among the
rich Okay you can feel that right Suppose suppose you thought it were was
true that the Republicans were going to treat the less rich people as sort of
you know low priority Well that would be pretty good persuasion All right The Republicans are
saying that Democrats want tax hikes handouts for illegal immigrants and to
protect fraud Is that persuasive
No No that's not persuasive Democrats want tax hikes
It just sort of sits there because I you know you always expect all your politicians want to do attacks hike How
about handouts for illegal immigrants Well I mean the Democrats
kind of like that Uh how about protecting fraud Nobody even knows what that
is So if you compare the the messaging the Democrats have the better persuasion
They've got the something is taken away Um now you could argue
that the Republicans saying that Democrats want tax hikes is taking something away but it's
not worded that way If they wanted it to be persuasive
uh the Republicans would say Democrats want to pick your pocket
then it then it's turned into taking something away which would be better persuasion and handouts for illegal
immigrants I don't know how how many people are feeling like they're directly
affected by that It's a little conceptual And then protect
fraud Do they really want to protect fraud Do you really think the other side
wants to protect fraud That's not very not very
persuasive Um so I would say that the Democrats have a stronger just messaging
wise They're a little bit stronger on that Well there's yet another JFK file
hearing in Congress And Representative Anna Paulina Luna she says uh based on
the new evidence presented during yesterday's JFK hearing it is increasingly clear that elements within
our own government have been blocking the release of truth pertaining to the assassination of President
Kennedy And I guess Mr hard away from the select committee on assassination
said for the past 62 years the CIA has actively and continuously obstructed the
investigation of the assassination blah blah blah How many of you think you're
ever going to figure out or ever know for sure what happened with
JFK I I feel like the default is that the the elements of the CIA and elements
of our government and elements of the mafia which would have a connection to
the CIA um assassinated the president I feel like I don't really
need to know much more you know maybe the names of the people involved but how
many of you think it's not some people in the government some people in the CIA and some people in the
mafia I feel like that's just kind of obvious at this point So I don't have
any curiosity about it at all anymore To to me it looks like it's you
know case closed That's exactly what it was But uh do you remember when we were
gonna see stuff about UFOs Are you still waiting for your
UFO Your UFO files I can't wait for them to open up
that warehouse that's got all the down UFOs that we keep
finding No we will never see any UFOs What about the Epstein
files I don't know Cash Patel still says they're coming but
are you really you really going to see any good stuff I don't know It doesn't
seem likely Well uh as you know Trump is
going hard at Harvard and he's now telling them that they have to get rid
of their international undergrad students They're about 6,800 of them And
uh one of the things they do is they pay full price for tuition which is you know
unusual So it's bad for Harvard on a um income
level but uh might be bad for them on a number of other levels So that's a big
deal But I was listening to Mike Ben talk about Harvard's real role And it
turns out if you thought Harvard was just a college with a great reputation
and they were doing some research for the government you know there was some funding for research You were not even
close to understanding what Harvard was or is apparently Um and I I can't do a good
job of explaining the Mike Ben's take on it but Harvard is
basically part of the deep state CIA
uh revolving door with so so right now um who is it Jake Sullivan Mike's Mike
Benz is pointing this out So Jake Sullivan a Democrat who had recently
been in charge of the um state DoD and CIA portfolios for Biden and as soon as
the administration is replaced by Republicans he goes to work at
Harvard and basically just goes into the same kind of you know power operation
It's just through Harvard So Harvard apparently had gigantic funding whole
all kinds of connections to the government It was using many of its
departments of which you know the almost uncountable number of entities within
Harvard to to work against Trump and against
um to create censorship including probably censorship of the of the local
population and to influence other governments
So whatever you thought Harvard was apparently it wasn't
that It was a very dark powerful um you know maybe running the country
from the background It's almost impossible to understand how much power they had and
still have But I guess Trump understands because he's you know dismantling their
funding and you know trying to bring them under control So I can't do a good job of
explaining this So listen to Mike Benz talking about uh all the things that Harvard is uh up
to Um yeah I I guess I'll stay away from
all the details there because he does it better All right
Um let's talk about this Have you noticed that the Democrats are at least pretending to be
in the process of some kind of awakening You know Jake Tapper is
suddenly awakened to the idea that Biden's brain was
defective and uh Morning Joe they're now sort of awakened to the fact that the
administration could be lying to them on a regular basis And it makes you
wonder could it be the beginning of a larger awakening I don't know But uh I posted
this yesterday and got 1.2 million views I said 'If you were surprised Biden's
brain was broken and you were shocked to learn the fine people story was a hoax
wait until you learned January 6 was the opposite of an
insurrection cuz I feel like you can you know maybe it's a long shot but I wonder
if you could further awaken the Democrats so they understand that they
were always the bad guys The the thing that always amazed me about January 6
um is that nobody ever talked to the people who were protesting to ask them
what their intention was And that's the most important part of the story right It's the dog that's
not barking times thousands There were thousands of dogs let's just
say attendees and they were they were either thinking to themselves that election was
totally fair but we don't like it so we're going to try to overthrow the government Now that's what the
Democratleaning uh press has been telling you for
years Is that true Well nobody asked the protesters
I would think that you would bring in a panel of protesters and say "All right what were you
thinking?" Now some of them you know I don't know 1% or something were violent
and probably did want to overthrow the country and you know who knows what but
I'll bet 98% thought to themselves
um I think this election looks like it was rigged I'd like to take a pause to
make sure it wasn't That would be protecting the republic That would be overthrowing an
insurrection Now that doesn't mean they're right but their
intention is the entire story Somehow we got sold on the idea
that their physical actions told you everything you needed to know Well they
physically trespassed They physically entered the building They physically
tried to delay things So therefore it was an insurrection That's not how that
works Everything depended on what they were thinking and nobody ever asked or
or at least didn't ask enough of them that you would get a sense for it And in
my opinion it's obvious that what they were thinking is that the the government
had been overthrown and they were looking at a way to make sure that it
was protected They were trying to protect the republic and they thought that they could do something by you know
entering the building and protesting and slowing things down and maybe getting a little pause to check the the hinkiness
of the vote Now now how many of you have ever just noticed that the most important thing
what were they thinking has been completely ignored It's all you need to know All
you need to know is that the news completely ignored the absolute number
one important thing What were they
thinking Unbelievable So I'd love to see someday the Democrats
say "Wait a minute Are you telling me that they weren't there to overthrow the government?" Yes that's what I'm telling
you They were not there to overthrow the government They were there to protect the government and you put them in
 jail you bastards
Anyway I'm going to give you a vague update on my health situation
Most of you are up to date You know that I have a a fatal form of cancer
um prostate that has uh metastasized my bones So in theory if I didn't do
anything and and it's sort of incurable so there's not much you can do uh I
would be dead pretty soon However um I have decided on a path of treatment
that I'm not going to tell you about Now it has to do with real
doctors It It's not going to be me grazing in my backyard and rubbing mud
on myself like most of you are recommending Uh I'm not going to be taking
Ivormect you know I'm not going to be spending more time in the sun I'm
sure all those are good things but I don't believe any of them would make me better I think somebody would have
noticed if you could cure in incurable cancers with you know just sort of minor
diet changes and things like that So the reason I'm not going to tell you what
I'm going to do is because I know what the reaction would be Somebody would
tell me I'm crazy and you know I should eat mud and um do some damn thing And so
the the goodwill that I experienced for the last several days which has been really good like unbelievably kind and
generous started to turn today So now the the uh the antiaxers came out and I
knew that was going to happen The antivaxers came out and they're they're asking "Huh did uh did you get the
cancer after you got the vaccination And these are just terrible people Now
I'm not even saying that it's the wrong question What I'm saying is it's not the right question for you Might be a
question for a doctor might be a good question for a researcher might be a good question for me but it's not what
you should be speculating on And by the way if you go to Grock or some AI you'll
find out that there's no no known connection At least at least that's what the official word
is But so I won't tell you what I'm doing but I'll tell you that my odds of survival
um just because I've picked a path that most of you have never heard of All
right So if you're saying to yourself I wonder if it's X No because you've heard of it If you
say I wonder if it's why it isn't because you've heard of
that So only only a very few of you would have ever even heard of the path
I'm taking But but it's with top doctors It's not something I'm making up and you
know it's not some little thing I'm doing on my own It's with top doctors in the field who know a lot about this And
it looks like my odds of survival may have jumped from zero to something closer to
30% Which means don't do my funeral
yet I've got a I've got a solid 30% chance of uh getting on the other side
of this And by the way this is brand new Like this is information that I was not
aware of until just recently So I will give you updates at some point but not
until I know if it's working which actually won't take long So in a matter
of I don't know a month or so uh I should have a pretty good idea if it's
working But I'll let you know Now some of you want might want to click
off now Let's see what time it is Uh but because I'm getting such push
back from the antivaxers I wondered if you'd like to
do a quiz to find out how much you really know about the
vaccination versus the co Um cuz I'm curious cuz I think 20% of
the country didn't get vaccinated and they're very happy that they didn't and they would consider themselves
uh purebreds and heroes Now what I'm observing and I can't tell
for sure what people are thinking is it looks to me like the people who went through the pandemic and got what they
considered to be the right answer while most of the world was getting the wrong
answer They're sort of trapped in a world where that was their greatest hits And they want to relive that
feeling where they got everything right And it is so
annoying that that it's just absolutely unbelievable So I wanted to give you a
little quiz especially if you're an antiaxer Uh but everybody can play
Question number one true or false that during the the initial part of people
getting vaccinated elite athletes were dropping dead on the field
uh in a in a way that would be way outside of the norm Jurv's elite
athletes were just falling down dead on the field How many of you think that that
was true The answer is not true There's no evidence for it
whatsoever Number two how many of you think the
virus was basically just a common cold versus a
uh a weaponized virus So how many of you think it was just a common cold versus a
weaponized virus Well we know it was made in a gain of
function lab and the gain of function lab would
have what purpose Why here I guess this is a related question Why would a
lab even work on gain of function What would be the point of doing it
The answer is to make it more dangerous or to be ready in case
somebody else made one more dangerous At what point did you know it
was coming from a gain of function lab And did you know that the gain of
function only has one purpose which is weaponization or protection from
weaponization which is a bad argument So when you got when you either
decided to get the shot or not the shot did you know that it was
weaponized Next question Given that America funded it and there
must have been Americans involved you know spooky people do you
think that the people who developed the shots were told by the military or CIA
or whoever was involved um what the nature of the weaponization was so that
when they worked on the shot they could make sure that they were directly
addressing the weaponization I don't know So that one I
I don't know the answer to that but if they did know it seems likely they would have told the people developing the shot
so they could get the best outcome Next question If you were going to weaponize
a virus how quickly would you make it um
kill somebody Would you make it operate
really fast as in you know within a week or would you make it people
so that everybody had to take care of them for the rest of their life The answer is that if you're
weaponizing it you don't make it so that it instantly kills people You make it so
that it weakens them or weakens the society
weakening the society would be pretty devastating Now next
question If you got if you got CO without the
shot what would and you were male what would happen to your testosterone would your testosterone go
up Would it stay the same if you just got COVID without any shot or or would
it um go down Well according to Grock it would go
down That's what Grock says Now would it stay
down or would it just be temporary And the according to Grock if
you got long CO it might stay down Is long CO
real According to Grock yes So if you were designing a weapon
that you thought was going to some other society would it be a good weapon if you
lowered their testosterone uh for some percentage of their population and you kept it low Would
that be a good weapon Because those people would you know they would not be as
aggressive They might not reproduce as much They might not be as successful
Yeah it would be a good weapon It'd be a really good weapon Next for people who
are older well I think we all agree that if you're a young person you got the shot that was probably a bad decision
because it was more bad than good when you're young But let's say you're over 60
Does the science at the moment doesn't mean it's right but does the science
tell you that it protected people from long co if they got the
shot And the answer is yes Now that doesn't mean it's true but if
you check any Google source or Grock or AI that they'll all tell you that if you
got the shot you were much less likely to get long co and the long
co would be the weaponized thing So putting it all
together when did you know it was weaponized versus just a common
cold And did you know that being weaponized meant that they would give you some
long-term kind of problems like being sleepy or having low testosterone or you
know just some kind of long-term problem Would you know that that would be the goal of it of a weaponized virus versus
killing you right away How many of you would know
that All right Um and what would be the bigger
risk Would the bigger risk be that if you didn't get the
shot then you wouldn't have those spike proteins running around But if you did
get the shot your chances of long CO would be far
less Which of those is the biggest um health
risk I don't know beats me But how would you
know Um all right I guess that's the
uh I guess those are the questions I want to ask So here's my here's my take on it
If you're in the 20% who are really proud of the fact that you got the right
answer by not introducing yourself to that risk did you consider the things
that I just talked about that it was weaponized that the long co would be the
presumed goal of it and that the shot probably was designed to reduce the
longco effect even far more than reducing the ability for it to spread
which it never really
did All right Now some of the things I told you uh may not be true but they
would be the things that you would find if you looked online and tried to research it So I think I got that right
All right So if you if you got a 100% on that u on that quiz then you can give
advice about whether people should have had the shot or not And if you got any
of that wrong then maybe you got the right answer but didn't do the
analysis at least the way some people would have done it All right
the Sha had no benefit Now so you would doubt uh
everything that's online right If you're saying the shot had no benefit you're
saying that it would not reduce long COVID It would not reduce hospitalizations for people over 60 But
a 100% of all the science unless they made it up 100% of
all the science says it did reduce your hospitalization risk and it did reduce
your long COVID risk You you can do the search yourself Now that doesn't mean
it's true but that's what we know at this point If you believe that
uh are you saying long co isn't a thing Well if you go to Grock it'll tell you
it is a thing So I guess I guess you're doubting
all the science and all the AI and everything that's
online could be right You could be right But if you didn't even think of those
things when you did the analysis then you were probably missing some
tricks All right that's all I got for now I know that's annoying but I'm
trying to head off the uh the the most annoying people in the
world who didn't get it vaccinated the pure bloods Um don't live in the past
You got that one thing right That's it It doesn't mean that you
know what I mean does for cancer It It's not a It's not an
indication that you'll get the next thing right They're just not
connected So [Music] um I'm just looking at looking at your
comments now All right Thanks everybody Thanks for joining Um I will see you
