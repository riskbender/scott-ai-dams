far uh let's uh check on the stock market it looks a little bit
flat that's all right it was up yesterday so let's uh check on our
comments make sure I can see what you're saying i have to warn you that today my
mental capacity is about 50% normal
so if I sound like a host on MSNBC it's not your
[Music]
[Music] imagination good morning everybody and
welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's called Coffee with Scott
Adams and I'm pretty sure you've never had a better time but if you'd like to
take a chance on rising let's say lifting lifting your
experience to new levels all you need is a cup mug or a glass of tanker gels in a
canteen jug or flask vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine hit
of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called that's right the simultaneous sip and it
happens now
go all right now I'm good i wonder if there are any scientific
studies that they didn't need to do because they could just ask me oh here we go eric Nolan and Cypost is
writing there's a new study that says that sexual activity before bed improves
objective sleep quality so did anybody besides me know that sex
before bed allows you to get to sleep better apparently it works whether you
have a partner or not uh is there anybody who didn't know
that that might be the most well-known fact in all of human history
you you you could look you could look for the rest of your life trying to find
somebody who didn't know that and you would never find anybody who didn't know
it and they did a study on it oh my god
okay well Starship launch uh was either successful or
unsuccessful depending on how you define success if you're business insider you'd
say it was unsuccessful because you don't like Elon Musk but if you were
more science and technology oriented you'd say it got further than uh ever
before and they learned a bunch of things and uh they're they're uh well
along in other words uh it was a failure that taught them a bunch of things which
is why they do it they're they're uh trying to learn a bunch of things so
that the next time they do it it gets a little bit further so let's call it a
success because they learned a bunch of things and they got further than they've been before speaking of Elon Musk makes
me think of Tesla which makes me think of this new feature sawyer Merritt's
talking about this on X apparently your Tesla will soon be
able to identify if you left a child in your car so if you leave a child
unattended in your car which I know you all like to do
um the car will flash and the lights will play and there'll be some kind of
alert and a notification will be sent to your Tesla app if the child is detected
kind of makes you wonder how old does a kid have to
be because what if your kid is 12 years
old would it say your kid is un unattended i don't know 11 10 how does
it know i don't know seems like a uh step forward so I'm not going to mock it
probably will save lives um the the other thing it might do is
drive it home you could just drive it home and unlock the door or roll down the windows
don't you think it could roll down the window a little bit i don't know there's a lot of ways that could have
gone well here's the nerdiest sounding thing that might be a really big deal uh
let's see if I can make this make sense according to interesting engineering uh
there's a new stretchable metal pretty exciting huh yeah when you
decided to watch this podcast you said to yourself I wonder I wonder if there's
any new stretchable metals well it turns out there is um and there's a
stretchable metal that delivers believe it or not 90% of the carno efficiency
for heating and cooling well that's pretty amazing yeah no 90%
of the caro efficiency uh that's a thing I guess and it's 20 times better than
traditional alloys all right so the bottom line is that there's a new technology that seems practical
uh that would just gigantically change your ability to do
heating and cooling and make a heat pump uh that works with you know regular
electricity but is way way way way more efficient now imagine what would happen
to our energy needs if we could cool things and heat things way way way way
better than we ever have before well that's coming up so you remember how uh LA Mayor Karen
Bass was bragging that uh things were going well in the Palisades and the
rebuilding and the issuing of permits well she caught a little bit of
heat for that according to the New York Post um if you want to put things in
perspective uh there have been 68 building permits have been issued for 52
addresses so 52 addresses it's pretty good right
52 well that's not so good if you consider there are 6,800 properties and
so that would be less than 1% so Karen Bass is up there standing in
front of the one of the very few homes that is being built and uh getting her
picture taken and uh only 1% have been
approved that's not good but at least we're going to get the
golden dome that will protect us from incoming missiles
um and according to Trump uh he told Canada who wants to get in on this uh
that if they become part of the USA that Canada will pay nothing to be
part of the dome pretty good deal right your costs will be nothing
but if Canada wants to stay an independent nation they will pay $61
billion for their part of the dome and according
to according to Trump Canada is considering his offer of becoming part
of the United States so they can save money on the
dome is there anybody who believes that do do you believe that he had
a he had a conver conversation with anybody in Canada who said "Wait a
minute are you telling me I can get a big discount on the Golden Dome if I
give up my sovereignty?" Well let me get back to you on
that maybe we will give up our sovereignty after all i didn't I didn't realize I could
make so much money by giving up my sovereignty okay I'm going to say that might
be a little bit of a salesman talk there just just a little bit little bit of
salesman talk well RFK Jr and his uh his cohorts
in the uh health part of the government I guess um they're taking COVID shots
off the vaccine schedule for healthy kids and pregnant women
um I'm going to assume without looking into it that some science was
involved what do you think do you do you think he just
guessed because his critics act like he just makes up but I'm pretty sure they looked at
the science and didn't see a reason to give healthy kids the COVID shots or
pregnant women so uh and I always here's
one of the things that always uh amuses me about the uh you know any of the
controversy about the CO shots everybody seems to be trusting
experts so you're either trusting the official experts or you're trusting the
experts to say the official experts got it wrong but isn't there always an
expert on both sides and if you're not listening to either of the experts and
I'm not saying you should because it's a weird world what exactly are you relying
on did Did you do some tests yourself in the
backyard it's hard not to rely on an expert isn't it because there's always somebody who said 'Well according to me
uh here's a here's a little experiment I want you to try at
home um th this will work for my audience especially so probably my audience would
say that the spike protein stays in your body right and that it causes
trouble if you go to Grock it'll say the spike protein just
leaves your body quickly and and then do the same test with everything you believe to be true
now I'm not saying that Grock is right i'm just saying that it's going to blow
your freaking mind when you test every assumption that you believe is true
about COVID and the CO shots almost nothing you think is true will be backed
up by the by the Grock summary of what is true now I'm not saying Grock is
true uh but I'm also not saying I know what is true i have no idea but how do you
write history when there's just no agreement on on history at all like what was
dangerous what's not dangerous anyway so I did that exercise the other day and it
just blew my freaking mind that that the common assumptions
that Grock will tell you with great confidence are absolutely opposite of
what I would say almost everybody watching believes to be true but I don't
know what's true anyway NPR is suing President Trump over his order to cut
their funding what exactly gives them the right to sue somebody over the privilege of being
funded by the government and first of all it's not like they get all their funding from the
government it's only a little bit so they don't have to go out of business they you know they just have to adjust
but President Trump is suing the state of North Carolina for refusing to wipe
ineligible voters off their voting roles have we reached the
point where all action is just
lawsuits and it doesn't matter what you do or what your reason is or what your
authority is or what the constitution says or what the law says somebody's
going to sue your ass for absolutely everything you do so I don't know who's going to win
but how in the world is North Carolina refusing to wipe ineligible voters off
their rolls like what would be their argument for you want us to get rid of
the ineligible voters well what kind of a authoritarian
does that what what exactly is the argument for keeping ineligible voters on the
rolls i assume they say they might be eligible i don't know
well according to the Rasmusen poll the polling company Rasmusen
uh there's a Trump effect that for the first time ever since they've been tracking this
um that uh the majority of the public 50% just barely majority believes that
the country is on the right track so there for 20 years Rasmuson's been
tracking it and this is the first time ever that the country thought it was on
the right track is it true no it's not true because we're
heading toward a deficit cliff we're definitely not on the right track we're we're on a track towards
certain doom for the first time in my life i've never been in a situation well that
I can remember we always had risks right like we always always had a risk that
maybe the Soviet Union would nuke us but probably not right and we we had risks
that I don't know the communists would take over the country or something but
probably not but at the moment we have a budget
situation in which we know we're heading right toward the cliff and it doesn't seem that we have
any ability to stop it so it's the first time in my life where I could say unambiguously we're on
the wrong track because we can't stop the one thing that would take us
out so uh I'm glad everybody else was happy for at least 50% of the
country but it is but it is impressive that uh Trump convinced the most people
ever that we're on the right track can we fix this uh problem with the deficit
well I'll talk about that more in a minute at the same time a separate poll by the
economist um says that Republicans
favorability is better than the Democrats so the GOP has a net favorability rating
of 111% so that's something to brag about
because it's better than the Democrats who are even 10 points behind that so
Democrats have a net favorability rating of negative
21% the political parties it it's it amazes me that that everybody's picking
the the least terrible party like huh well I could go with the party that's
negative 21% favorability but I'm no fool so I'm
going to go with the one that's only -1 well those are your two choices
people or negative
21% have you noticed that the Democrats seem to be unleashed to dump
on other uh Democrats uh and to say all the things that are wrong because it's
all they have to say they don't have any leadership if they had leadership the
leaders would be telling them "Hey don't dump on Democrats say the Democrats are
getting everything right and the Republicans are getting everything wrong." But they have no leaders so the
way they can get attention now is by who can be the the most
insightful Democrat complaining about Democrats so now we have this weird situation
where Republicans can complain about Democrats and then Democrats are also
complaining about Democrats we've never seen this before
right it's the first time that Democrats have just a free pass and and there's
nothing stopping them from saying you know looks like Democrats did everything wrong and it doesn't look like we
figured out how to fix it i've never seen this before so
um on CNN uh Ro Kana Representative Kana he said uh Kla
Harris for whatever you say about her did connect with people culturally did
she did she connect with men no she didn't connect with men men
were leaving the party like crazy anyway he said that she did connect with people
culturally i think the problem with the party is that we didn't have a clear economic vision for workingclass
Americans really was that the one problem with the
party it had nothing to do with the fact that the main candidate was mentally
defective and and they were hiding it and the backup candidate the vice
president was a drunken idiot it's not the drunken idiot problem so not only do Democrats have a
free pass to criticize their own party but they're not even doing that
right do you think that if they had a economic
vision for workingclass Americans but they were on the 20 side of every 8020
uh policy do you do you think that they would have ridden into victory because
they got the one thing right an economic vision for workingclass Americans
if they had an economic vision for workingclass Americans do you know what that would have looked
like republican policy this is a terrible
analysis they're acting like the only the only problem they had was they
weren't copying Republicans enough on economic policy for middle class
Americans wow and Roan is one of the smart ones and he
he's like a 100 miles away from even understanding what the problem was anyway uh as you know uh Democrats
been trying to win back men by coming up with big words and studying their
syntax we talked about that already some some uh consultant came up with a
$20 million proposition and I guess I got funded to go look into uh how they
message men like that's the problem it's not the messaging it's not your choice of words
i promise you if you think that the problem with with losing men from the
Democrat party is because you use the wrong words you're you're you're as far as
Roan is away from understanding anything about anything that happened in the last 10 years now how many of you can back me
up on the following statement now this this is going to be a
big claim i'm going to make a large claim and I want to see if I have backing for it or if I'm just totally
off base in 2016 I was the first person in America
who said "Uhoh it's obvious that the Democrats
are becoming the party of women and men are going to defect." I was the first person in the
country who pointed that out and I did it a lot i mean I mentioned that a lot
can you confirm or deny those of you who were with me 10 years ago i did say that
right and I I gave examples and I blamed Hillary Clinton and I said the messaging
is all female yeah okay in the comments I'm getting a string of yeses so you do
remember that so the next time I tell you that something's going to be
true maybe you'll listen to me i I have to admit that was a
stunningly good prediction because absolutely nobody else was saying that in 2016 and I was
saying it often it's like hey you know you're turning into the party of women
and men are going to get the hell out of there and sure enough that's exactly
what happened and I think Hillary is the one who killed the party
actually news Nation had a uh looked like an exclusive uh
story that right at the end of the Biden administration um that they put in a a
farm loan forgiveness program that was for everybody except white farmers
so it was irrelevant what your economic situation was because of course there
were a lot of white farmers who weren't doing great uh but it was only for the
disadvantaged people or whatever they wanted to call them and that I guess there was some lawsuit and some court
said you can't do that that would be obviously unconstitutional to give money only to
certain ethnic groups and deny it to others so as a response the Biden
administration um made it available to everybody and
then they only sent out notices to non-white
farmers so the only people who knew that they could get the the forgiveness and
you know they would have to do some process to get it the only ones who were informed were the non-white
farmers and and allegedly um the s the people who were in charge
and did that are still in charge of whatever government entity does that
kind of stuff so unbelievable racism speaking of
race there was a recent uh Pew Research survey uh that said many respondents
reported feeling exhausted or angry when thinking about race relations now I
think that's different than black fatigue which I saw some somebody
explaining that black fatigue is not what you think it is it's not white people being tired of uh race related
things uh it's something else i I forget what it was it's based on some book but
uh this does ring true that uh people are exhausted by the topic and we're
just sick of hearing him and that uh almost four in 10 Republican
respondents said they were uninterested in issues of race uh whereas only 15% of Democrats
were saying the same thing all right here's my take um I don't believe in privileged
problems is it true that there's a thing called systemic racism yes uh it to me
it seems obvious yes there's definitely systemic racism is it
true well let me back up a bit i've taught you what it means to uh make
somebody think past the sale um thinking past the sale would be
if you're a car salesperson and you say you know uh what color do you want this
car if you can get somebody to answer that question then they've already thought
past the question of whether they're going to buy that car so it doesn't work every time but
it's a well-known technique in persuasion to get somebody to
uncritically think past the the most important part and think to the less
important part that's in the future and then their brain just sort of uncritically thinks well I guess I
decided to buy this car well that's what the pro that's how I
see race at the moment because there's an uncritical thing we've been asked to
accept which is that that race related problems and let's say um systemic
racism which again I think is real uh is the biggest problem to worry
about now it's not a nothing problem but where's the evidence that
it's the biggest problem there's no evidence that I've seen so the whole thing is a scam
because it assumes that because you know slavery
was a gigantic problem you know largest problem you could imagine jim Crow
gigantic problem that that in the current times
it's also the biggest problem and the thing that you have to worry about and it's bigger than other people's
problems i don't buy that do do you think that uh do you
think that the average black person who's looking for a job has a bigger
problem than I do right now because I'm going to be dead pretty soon unless a miracle happens don't I
have a bigger problem and if you just look around at the people you
know don't don't they have gigantic problems i mean if you were born looking
a certain way or you know your your physicality was a certain thing or your
IQ wasn't that high or or you got into an abusive relationships or you have
maybe a substance problem which isn't your fault because a lot of that is
genetic who says that race is the biggest problem and that we should put
like extra work into that what who has privileged
problems there's no privileged problems it's just a bunch of people with problems and if you ask them they'd say
their own problems are the biggest ones cuz sometimes they are so I can accept
every bit of what uh let's say black Americans just to pick an example say is
a problem and I would say "Yep that sounds like a problem." But is it bigger than
mine is it bigger than my neighbor's problem where's that argument you know
why do I have to stop everything to work on your problem so the the making you think past
the sale is the is the exhausting part yeah i would say that black America
has a strategy problem well maybe everybody does you don't even have to
limit it if I said to you um or if you said to me "But what about employment
you know black people have discrimination in employment." I would say "No you don't you have a bad
strategy." If your strategy was to go try to get a job at a company that has a
DEI leaning even if they don't call it that you would easily get the job over
other people who were equally qualified so getting a job would be easy
if you also had a strategy now I would also say you know you're going to have to study in school and get good grades
but once you've done that that's the same as what everybody has to do they all have to study and get good grades or
things aren't going to work out or learn a skill if I told you well how about a
strategy why don't you learn a skill that would help you
so I don't believe that there's a race problem so much as there is a strategy
problem because the society has adapted so that no matter what your race
is you can either go toward DEI or you can get the away from it depending
on which one's your better strategy now I got cancelled from saying that sometimes you
want to just get the away from things that are negative for you that's a
strategy it's not a crime if if you can go somewhere where
the DEI won't be denying you a job because you're white you should do that
you should do that right away if you can go to where there is less crime against
people who look like you you should do that you should do it right away if you
can go to any place where people don't think that the reason they're suffering
is because of people who look like you you should do that as soon as possible
get the away from people who think that you have their stuff because you
don't have their stuff you didn't steal their stuff so if you can get away from people
who think like that you should do it and likewise if you if you want to a
boost a strategic advantage in getting a job you should go toward DEI if DEI is
going to help you and I wouldn't I wouldn't criticize you for that i would say "Oh that's a good
strategy very good strategy you should go toward it." So no we don't have a
race problem we have a strategy problem
let's talk about Doge shall we so Matt Van Matt Van Swall has been
getting a lot of attention on X for uh complaining that the Congress is not
taking the Doge cuts seriously and not incorporating them uh today he said uh
turns out liberals didn't have to stop the Doge cuts by firebombing Tesla
dealerships or calling for the death of Elon or vandalizing Teslas across
America all they had to do was to ask the GOP to to do anything at all
for the American people that's all it took
and that that one hit hard because that I don't know if you're
having the same experience but watching the GOP apparently screw the the
Republicans who had been backing them the Democrats really didn't even have to get
involved they could have just let the GOP screw the Republicans and they
didn't have to do all that work of you know setting anything on fire
now you might say that's a little hyperbole and he's gone too far but u
dantis governor dantis he also blasted the uh the house GOP for failing to
codify the doge cuts according to the New York Post he called it a betrayal of
the voters and he accused uh congressional Republicans uh of betrayal by failing to
codify the spending cuts now Stephen
Miller who I consider one of the smartest people who
has ever been in government and uh one of the good guys if you're a MAGAT type
or a proTrump person he tried to explain to the public and he's done this a few times on
X what the problem is now you say to yourself uh why isn't
this easy doge told them what to cut and then they did a
budget and it doesn't seem that they cut anything that Doge
recommended what What part are we not understanding well it turns out there's a lot we're not
understanding and I'm going to see if you understand Steven Miller's
explanation the uh I'll give you a a hint where it's heading
there's no such thing as the budget there's a whole bunch of
complications of what you can and cannot do of your discretionary budget versus
your non-discretionary budget versus your reconcil reconciliation bill which
is different from a recessions a recessions package
some of those things would require just 50 votes which the Republicans have a good
chance of getting so if they use one of these hard to understand
processes they might be able to get something like at least the Republican
priorities passed but if they tried to do
cuts they would have to use maybe a different process don't call it a budget
you might call it a recisions package or or a reconciliation bill but don't call
it a budget uh but you would need 60 votes depending on which archaic hard to
understand process they're using and the Republicans can't get 60 votes because
uh the Democrats would filibuster etc all right so that's my idiot
explanation of what's going on but I'm going to I'm just going to read Steven Miller's explanation because I believe
he's 100% technically correct but here's what I'm not
satisfied with don't tell me what you can't
do don't tell me what you can't do he's doing that very accurately I
believe so now I understand what the the problem is i need him to tell me or
somebody how you're going to cut the budget and save us all i don't need you
to tell me how you can't do it i don't need you to tell me the rules don't allow it you don't have enough
votes that's good to know I suppose but you need to tell me how you can do it
and when it's going to happen okay so but it is fair it's completely
fair because he's one of the smartest guys and I I believe that his
explanation will be perfectly accurate so I'd like to read it to you so you've also heard it but you're probably going
to have the same reaction I am which is "I get it but don't tell me what you
can't do tell me what you can do and when are you going to do it or tell
me that you can't do it ever and that we're just going to go over the the cliff." Whichever is true I want to know
but don't just tell me what you can't  do and here's what you can't
 do so Steven Miller says on Acts "The
Doge cuts are to discretionary spending eg the federal
bureaucracy." Okay discretionary though what does the word discretionary mean to
you discretionary means you have a choice right and then the Doge cuts are
to the stuff that you would have a choice about perfect that's exactly what I thought they were
oh but it turns out that the word discretionary doesn't mean what you think it
does he goes on under Senate budget rules you cannot cut discretionary
spending you can only cut mandatory because it's a reconciliation
bill okay so it's not a budget it's a reconciliation bill and in a
reconciliation bill the thing you can't cut is the discretionary which is
exactly the stuff that the word says you should be able to cut because that's what discretionary means but you can cut
mandatory even though mandatory means the opposite of how it's being used because mandatory should be the
stuff you can cut but it turns out you can cut the mandatory but not the discretionary because it's a
reconciliation bill you got that everybody understand that makes perfect
sense i guess that's the Senate rule u and again remember Stephen Miller
is probably 100% accurate right i doubt he's wrong it's just that the rules
themselves are just completely a mess then he goes on he says uh so Doge cuts
would have to be done through what is known as a recessions package or an
appropriations bill okay so I guess neither of those are what a
budget how many of you knew how many of you know what a recisions package or an
appropriations bill is none of you right none of you then he
goes on he says "The big beautiful bill the one we're working on there is not an annual budget bill
okay and does not fund the departments of
government okay it does not finance our agencies or
federal programs." Okay
instead it includes the single largest welfare reform in American history so
these are the good things it does along with the largest tax cut and reform in American history the most aggressive
energy exploration in American history and the strongest border bill in
American history all while reducing the deficit
so if that's the case uh we'd be getting a bunch of things
that Republicans would want while reducing the the deficit and I said to
myself huh wow all right well it's all complicated and it looks like it's a
bunch of to me but at least if it reduces the deficit that's pretty
good so somebody in the comments went to Grock to ask if that was uh true and
Grock says "The big beautiful bill likely increases the federal deficit."
Oh you mean the one thing I cared about uh despite claims otherwise
now remember this is Grock versus Steven Miller
stephen Miller again is a very reliable smartest guy so his claim is it reduces
the deficit but Grock says no no probably not independent analyses from
the CRFB who we can't trust and the Tax
Foundation who we can't trust because we don't really know who they are or what their motivations are estimate that this
bill would add 2.5 to 5 trillion to deficits over 10 years oh in other words
it would take us over the cliff mainly due to 3.8 8 trillion in tax cuts and
new spending uh Grock goes on to say "The
White House claims 1.6 trillion in savings from growth and cuts but
evidence for this is weak bond market reactions and the CBO estimates support
a deficit increase more scrutiny is needed as the
Senate reviews the bill." Okay
well did that clear everything up for you are you all happy now are are you
happy because you understand the difference between discretionary and non-discretionary and a reconciliation
bill versus a recessions package versus an appropriations bill according to the Senate rules and
apparently it's so complicated that we can't tell if it's going to kill us or
reduce the deficit so everybody happy now glad you
got a good explanation from your government all right so uh Elon Musk was
on CBS recently um just the other day I guess and uh he said quote "I think a
bill can be big or it could be beautiful uh but I don't know if it could be
both." and he told CBS Monday morning that he
was quote disappointed to see the Trumpbacked big beautiful spending bill
which passed in the house and must said he believes the legislation quote increases the budget deficit and
undermines the work that the Doge team is doing okay so if you're keeping score
Steven Miller says it will decrease the deficit but uh two of these entities or
three of them say it would increase the deficit quite a bit and the bond market
says it would increase the deficit elon Musk the smartest person in the world says it would um basically increase the
deficit and it turns out that there are at least four GOP senators who think it would
blow up the deficit so you've got uh Tillis Johnson
uh Scott and Ran Paul that would be four of them who
think that this is a budget buster
um and if the four of them hold tight it won't
pass because they they uh that would be I think one too
many to say no so we'll see if those four stop it
from happening i don't know what happens if they do
um all right does that all make sense for the first time
every everybody understand what the issue is what a freaking mess here's what I
want to be told how are you going to decrease the deficit now if you need to say stuff
like recisions packages and reconciliation and discretionary this
and mandatory that all right you can use those words and I'll you know I'll take
it upon myself to try to figure out what it all means but tell me when and how
you're going to reduce the deficit because if you can't tell me that everything else is just blah blah
blah all right in other news
uh Michael Steele is on MSNBC saying that the US deporting uh
that Abrago Garcia guy is no different than when an American is taken hostage
in the Middle East uh as I've often told you if your only
argument is an analogy it kind of means you don't have an
argument right why would you use such a weird argument that you know is just
laughable if you had a real argument why would you make an analogy
to the Middle East all right so that's all they got
um do you remember the story about the three top Pentagon officials that were fired last month
they apparently they were long-term friends of P Hegsath but they
got fired based on what we now believe are false allegations of
leaking but interestingly then Glenn Greenwald is pointing this out all three
of them were non-interventionists meaning they didn't want to attack Iran or basically they
were you know anti-war unless you really really needed to and uh now the White
House has concluded that the accusations were fabricated holy
so I don't know if that means they get their jobs back or even if they'd want them back but uh that's uh three
non-interventionists that got taken out by presumably
interventionists uh are they interventionists from our company our country or is it possible that another
country may have been involved in taking them out we don't know but that's a scary thing
uh the according to Politico the Trump administration has paused international
student visas uh as it's they're looking into the idea
of checking social media of foreign students before letting them into the country
so uh the State Department um and Secretary Rubio
uh they've signed an order to make sure that uh there's a
pause before they decide what to do with the social media vetting does it seem to
you like that's a good idea like why would you let somebody
into the country to give them the privilege of an American education at
some higher institution if they had a social media history that was sort of
grossly anti-American i feel like that's a a pretty fair thing
which you wouldn't you wouldn't necessarily well you wouldn't uh do to an American I don't think but
let me ask you this because I don't know the answer this is more of a a real question it's not um it's not making a
point it's an actual question so we Americans have freedom of speech but if
you applied for a you're just an American and you applied for
uh entry into one of our higher you know institutions of learning be it Harvard
or Yale or Princeton or something would they not look at your social media in in
2025 or 2026 wouldn't that be automatic or would
they ignore your social media because they would just say "Well that's just free speech whatever it says we don't
care as long as you meet our other academic standards." Could they really ignore
your social media so if we're doing the same thing with foreign
students that a college would sort of automatically do with an American
applicant is that the worst thing in the world i don't know so it's not a perfect
world and I like free speech but uh I guess I need to know a little bit
more about this topic before I have a a hard opinion on it well according to the New York Post
there were two Secret Service um professionals who were caught
brawling on camera outside uh Obama's home and here's the funny part um it
suspended the two of them i guess they were both female and they were uh in a
fist fight and uh during the brawl one federal officer allegedly grabbed her
radio and threatened to quote whoop this girl's ass
so there I'm not even going to say anything
more about it but it's just funny that outside of Obama's house there were two
female Secret Service people and one of them threatened to whoop this girl's ass
so anyway I hope they work that out according to Breitbart News the uh Trump
effect is working in Europe because Europe it looks like they're going to
budget 170 billion more for urgent rearmament you know Trump had been
pushing them to get their NATO spending up so that the US didn't have such a
burden over there so shouldn't that result in us being able to cut our
military spending no apparently not apparently if if Europe spends more so
that the US doesn't have to support them we still just spend more we just spend
it on different stuff so apparently we don't have any process for spending less
on military we can only spend more uh we'd like we found a way to um get
somebody else to spend a lot more on our military oh well then that gives us the
right to spend more on our own military it's like Doge cuts it's like there's
never a reason to go backwards apparently well allegedly according to the Wall
Street Journal people familiar with Trump's thinking i'm not sure that's
really a good source but people familiar with Trump's thinking as if you could be
familiar with Trump's thinking i don't even know if that's a thing could you
even if you knew exactly what he said would you still be familiar with
his thinking trump is the most unpredictable person
in some ways i mean he he likes to be uh strategically
unpredictable so I'm not sure you could ever be familiar with his thinking um
except for the things which he's been consistent on forever and then we'd already know but
anyway um so he's thinking he's weighing heavy sanctions against
Moscow because you know Putin's escalating the war and he seems to have no interest in stopping and I wonder
what kind of sanctions are left as far as I know the only sanctions
are left because uh according to this report they eliminated banking as one of the options so they're not going to
squeeze his banking um but I think it would be sanctions on
countries that bought energy from Russia so the sanctions would be on not
directly on Russia but on their customers does that
work or or do all those other countries have enough ways to pretend they're
getting the oil from somewhere else that it just wouldn't work at all i don't know
and then lastly uh according to Duke University there's
a new experimental drug that could uh end pain but it wouldn't be an opioid
and it wouldn't get you high so it already works on mice and uh the mice
allegedly are really pissed off that they they participated in a painkiller
experiment in which they' remove the fun part where the mice get high and the mice are like "Dude
really you're going to make us take this experimental drug and we don't even get a buzz off it?" And you're like "Come on
mice you signed up for this?" Then the mice would be like "We didn't sign up for this
you kidnapped us and then Michael Steele would say
[Music] um anyway I'm not going to take that any
further but there there'd be some kind of an analogy there I'm sure all right that's all I got for you
