but the rest of the platform is working great as far as I
know so we'll have comments and we'll have we'll have a
show on Memorial Day weekend when all the lazy people are off on vacation
[Music] good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization it's called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take your experience up to levels that nobody can understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a cup of mug or a glass of tanker Chelsea Stein a canteen jug or flask of vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day the thing
that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip that happens now
go so I'm going to ask a favor from one of the commenters
um one of you puts the entire simultaneous sip um with the wording in
the comments when I'm doing it don't do that because it's a it's a long block
which distracts me so I know you're I know you're trying to help but it's really distracting when
you put it in there as I'm talking about it because it makes me look and say "Oh what's this long block of text it's
probably something important so if you
could Don't do that anymore thank you that would be it would be hard to
know that that was a problem so don't worry about it well if the Xplatform is
working after the show uh Owen Gregorian will be hosting his spaces uh again a
coffee with Scott Adams afterparty um but it probably depends
highly on whether the the Xplatform is back online and uh if not you know maybe
it gets pushed to the next day but that's the that's the current thinking well if you happen to hate the
uh the New York Knicks that would be a basketball team uh you've had a good
week i I know most of you are not into basketball but I I just have to tell you
about how the Indiana Pacers uh beat the Knicks because it's not so
it's not even a sports story it's it's like the biggest coincidence in the
world story so the uh it was the game before this last
one and the Knicks were up by two and time was running out and one of
the better players on the Indian Indiana Pacers takes this long desperate
three-point shot if it goes in which would you know was highly unlikely the
the Pacers would win if it missed the Knicks would win so you you're watching
it go and it's really high and it's really far away and it hits the rim and
it misses and the Knicks are like "Yes yes we won the first game of this
playoff." And then the ball because the ball had come from a long distance when
it hit the rim it went up in the air for a very long distance as well and when it came
down it went right through the hoop it was something you would rarely
ever see now since it was a three-point shot the Pacers are like "Yes yes we won
because we were only down by two and we just made a three-point shot." And and
then they look at the video and the guy who shot it his foot was just on the
line which makes it a two-point shot so first the the Knicks totally won then
the Pacers totally won and then it was a tie and had to go to overtime where the
Pacers won so if you were a Knicks fan it was a terrible week and I guess they
won they lost another tight one all right I'm going to give you a movie
recommendation or movie review I guess so uh I don't know where it is except on
Amazon Prime prime Video but it's called The Fountain of Youth it's brand new and
it features John Krinski and Natalie Portman I think as his sister and they
play these Indiana Jones kind of characters now here's what's great about
this movie apparently I'm just
guessing my guess is that the director had some kind of deal with the
production studio they could make the movie any way he wanted to and he made it
old-fashiony and and you don't notice it at first you just think you're watching a movie excuse me hold on
but at some point you realize hey there was nobody tied to a chair hey there was
no gratuitous like sex scene or or those terrible scenes where somebody's showing
their love to somebody else and you're like I get it i get it you know all the things that you hate in a movie it just
simply didn't have them it was like a wisecracking um action movie so the wise
cracking was great because John Krosinski is great at wise cracking and the characters were great but then you
notice um it it did have one thing that I don't
like in a movie which is somebody who's underwater for too long i I fast forward
through all underwater scenes but then you realize wait a minute there's nothing woke about this
movie the the cast is not diverse um there's no there's no
overweight black woman who is the key feature it's just good-looking people
and the two female leads were both attractive and the you know the lead guy
was attractive too so when was the last time you saw a movie like
that there was nothing woke at all i don't know how he got it made i would
love to know the backstory uh was it Guy Richie it's a Guy Richie film so and
it's a fun for the whole family there's no um there's no swearing i think there
was zero swearing and basically it was sort of a a genius
movie of what he left out he just sort of left out everything that movies try
to put in there you know all the all the stuff you don't want to see so I recommend it fun for the whole
family well in other news according to Sai Post
uh nonright-handedness is more common across multiple mental health conditions
you know what nonright-handedness is it's called
left-handedness so apparently if you're left-handed you're more likely to have a variety of mental health
conditions now that probably includes if you're a leftist because you know how uh we've
already seen that the Democrats have more mental health problems and they're actually called leftists so apparently
anything left is correlated with mental health
problems anyway um in other news according to
Discover we tend to trust people from lowincome backgrounds over the wealthy
elites do you think that's true do you trust people from lowincome backgrounds
more than rich people um I think that
depends if you dropped your wallet would you rather a billionaire found it or
somebody from a lowinccome background i feel like I trust the
billionaire to give my wallet back so that's that's very situation
dependent but you can see why uh Joe Biden used to do I'm just lunch bill Joe
i'll take the train i'm just like you anyway according to uh some uh let's
say neuroscience news AI has higher emotional IQ than humans you know the
emotional IQ where you know you you know how to deal with people's emotional
states and your own etc and I thought to myself that kind of makes sense because
the AI can simply memorize all the situations and it can just say "All
right under this situation people should do this." So yes it makes total sense
that uh AI would have a higher emotional IQ could have just asked
me and it's a big deal actually it's a big difference the AI achieved an average score of
82% where the humans were at 56% so so if you want some empathy and
you want a high emotional IQ I suggest you get a robot robots can set you free according
to Fox News the ladies of the view have been asked by their boss the head of
Disney Bob Iger to cool it with all the political
chatter and then apparently the ladies of the view said "No we it's very important that we do
political chatter so we'll keep doing it." Um I don't know if that was a good idea
because if your boss tells you to do less of something you probably should do less of it but I can't believe I can't
believe that The View has the same ratings when they're being political and
essentially annoying half of the country don't you think their ratings would be higher if they just did everything about
politics so it seems like Bob Iger may have the right idea here but who knows if you
haven't seen this yet there's a some kind of AI called
VO3 in which they created a bunch of you know deep fake um street interviews so
it's a whole bunch of little clips where somebody's interviewing somebody in the street usually at night
and until now I always told myself you
know I could tell AI from reality but uh you
can't it it's not even just one or two things it's a whole string of street
interviews and you cannot you cannot tell that these are AI
so I don't know how far away we are from making a whole movie but that was scary so we've
crossed we we've crossed the Scot line where I say to myself "Ah I could tell
that was AI because they have six fingers or or there's something about them or the way they talk." You
absolutely can't tell that it 100% looks real
crazy meanwhile speaking of crazy and crazy eyes uh Hillary
Clinton uh is trying to ruin your Memorial Day weekend because she's made the following
suggestion in a post on X she said "I want you to talk to two people friends
neighbors cookout attendees about why Trump's proposed budget would be a
disaster for American kids." And then she goes on to give some
examples of what she's talking about can you think of a worse idea than bringing up the the
budget at your Memorial Day barbecue i can't think of a worse
idea does Hillary get invited to things she talks like somebody who's never been
invited to anything it's the worst idea of all time no how
about you just shut up about politics and enjoy your neighbors and your family
shut up just shut up about politics take take a uh take a message
from Bob Iger sometimes talking about politics could
be too much meanwhile according to the college
fix a Tennessee university is hit with civil rights complaints over 17
racebased scholarships so when they say race-based
it means you can't be a white guy basically but some of them are more specific like you could be an
African-American or a um or a
um I think Native American or something so some of them will give you two choices oh yeah native American or
African-American so there's 17 racebased scholarships
i I'm kind of happy that that stuff's being dismantled but don't you think it'll be put right back together as soon
as Trump is out of office you know don't you imagine that the minute there's a Democrat who's
president that everything that Trump has dismantled will just go right back to what the way it was
or could it be that the Democrats are happy he's dismantling it but they can't
say it out loud i don't know i I want to be happy about
the direction of things but I don't know how long it's going to last well uh Kla Harris according to
that new book by Jake Tapper um some time ago when she was uh
appearing on CNN and I think it was after uh Biden
did his catastrophic debate performance and she goes on CNN and she was asked
about basically Biden's brain and then she gets off and she
uh allegedly blasted Anderson Cooper as a mother
effer what oh um so
former so the the story is that she was very
mad about the question she was asked about the president's cognitive
ability and she said uh this this mfer
she used the actual full word this mfer doesn't treat me like the damn vice
president of the United States she told colleagues um and then she said "I thought we were
better than that." Well don't you think they were treating her like the vice president of
the United States cuz the vice president of the United States under the condition of the
president of the United States is showing that he's cognitively impaired isn't it exactly her job to figure out
whether the 25th amendment makes sense to me it seems like they were
treating her like the vice president she would be the number one person you should ask that question uh is it time
to replace this guy so I guess she didn't like having any tough questions
but um don't you feel lucky that she didn't
become president the the we were so close to
having a president Kla Harris you know the horse
laugh oh my god well Victor Davis Hansen was talking
about CNN and all the things that they've they've done that were opposite
of news and some of the things he listed was uh he actually went so hard as to say he
doesn't know how Jake Tapper is keeping his job at CNN because he mentions uh
Victor mentions the Russia collusion fail the steel dossier fail the Hunter
laptop fail and he says there's definitely a pattern to which I would
like to add the following what about the fine people hoax what about the whole auto pen story
there was nobody in the news business who who knew there was an autopen problem what about the Biden crime
family totally ignored uh what about the drinking bleach hoax yeah there's a
pattern but but the pattern all comes from the same place doesn't it the pattern comes from they they
created a a narrative that Trump was
Hiller once you've created the narrative that Trump is Hitler it gives you permission to lie about every
story because obviously you don't want to be complicit in making you know
Hitler in charge so they basically there was one problem
that caused them to no longer be a news entity and it was that they had convinced themselves that he was
Hitler so one problem caused 50
problems according to uh Liz Peak who's writing for The Hill
um they're still trying to figure out who is in charge of that autopen which is kind of hilarious
because it's one of the biggest well maybe the biggest story in the country
don't you think if the biggest story in the country was who's doing all that autopen stuff don't you think that the
people who were doing the autopen stuff should have said "Oh that that was me."
Yeah it was the three of us that this was our process but without that what are we
supposed to think there's only one thing you could think
if they decided to get real quiet about that process there's a
problem because if there were no problem it would have been like day two they
would have said "Oh here's how it works here's the process here's our you know
here's our diary of you know who did what and who signed it." the fact that
they're just quiet about it and they have that we have to do research to figure out who is behind the
autopan that's a that's a pretty good indication that there's a problem but
the thing that to me is scary is that there are two people who were mentioned as you know likely not
the only people necessarily but two of the main people who might have been behind the
autopan and what's scary is I'd never heard of them
you know if if the real answer had been had been uh you know Ron Clay or
uh Jake Sullivan I would have said "Huh you know
that's not ideal because the president's supposed to be doing the autopen stuff." But at least I would think you know this
is a well-known smarter person you know everybody's heard those names but the
names we're hearing are are uh Mike Donalan and Anita
Dunn how many of you had ever heard those names before the autopen
thing isn't that like giving you a little pause it's like huh not so sure who they even are so
part of the mystery is why do people we've never even heard of were signing all these things and
then there's the thought about all the clemencies you know weren't there like
thousands of clemencies that were signed and you thought to yourself how could
thousands of them being signed well the auto patent do you think anybody sold uh
a clemency i'll bet they did i'll bet somebody sold the clemency or two don't
know who um so Susan Rice you know
her from the sort of no Obama person so she was she did a little video
i don't I don't know what she was appearing on but she was saying that uh Trump has only looked at 12 uh daily
briefings in over a 100 days of being in office and the way she says it with her
wrinkled up eyebrows is that it's like he's not doing the job he's only seen 12
daily briefings only 12 in and over a 100 days now she says it in a way that she's
trying to sell the attitude not the facts because the facts don't
really they don't really tell a story but the attitude
[Music] oh you know she she scrunches up her
face so that you know it's a really big problem
but here's my interpretation what would be the second
reason that Trump would not be uh listening to all the daily briefings i'm
going to take a sip while you answer that
question what would be the other reason that he had only listened to some
of the briefings what would you say
the answer is they had determined that they're
 if they were useful don't you think he would listen to
them of course he would i I remember that the daily briefing included the Bin
Laden risk and I think Bush didn't even pay
attention to it because it was just on a list of whole bunch of things
and I also wonder if the daily briefing is maybe managed a little bit
by some Obama people who have gotten to some other people who can get to some other people
don't you think that Susan Rice is a a little bit too interested in the daily
briefings as if maybe the Democrats have figured out
how to influence somebody who does the daily briefings for the president and they're trying to manipulate him that
way but he's just not paying attention to them at all maybe well General Mike Flynn who of
course has seen daily briefings he said the uh daily briefings
is a complete waste of time financial resources and people he said Rice is
another Marxist who sees globalism as the future and I say if you can't trust
government employees to give you the right stuff who can you
trust well uh Senator Joanie Ernst is talking about something i think
you heard this from Elon and Doge at one point that there are $60 billion spent
on federal government credit cards and apparently there are twice as
many credit cards as there are federal government employees that That's a little red flag
right there h twice as many credit cards as employees but apparently it's worse
than that um because a lot she says that a lot of the card usage occurs during federal
holidays and on days like New Year's Eve at nightclubs and bars and Sunday afternoons and whenever
there's a big UFC fight and there also cash withdrawals at
casino ATMs so I guess they canled about half a million of those cards uh I think you've
heard that story before but the funny part is that it's so obvious that they were stealing because you could tell the
pattern of when the cards were being used well Trump has threatened the
European Union with a 50% tariff because they seem to be dragging
their feet you know dealing with the trade stuff um and part of it is that it's
complicated so the it's not just tariffs it's uh they got fees on streaming
services value added taxes they got automotive regulations and fines imposed
against US companies and antirust so it's a lot of stuff to untangle so
Trump's just saying "All right take your time but we're going to give you a 50%
tariff." I kind of like that wall Street Journal's reporting that
well according to uh one source I saw uh I saw it on a post by Luke Groman
that if all Chinese students were removed from all US colleges uh most of them would go
bankrupt because the Chinese students pay full price for tuition and the
colleges need that so if we remove all the Chinese students from all the
colleges besides just Harvard a lot of colleges would go out
of business but don't you think we're heading toward a situation where a lot of colleges need to go out of business
because they're not really adding enough value you know once you have AI it seems like you can make your own
college so not too worried about that
trump says US Steel will partner with Nippon Steel is it Nippon
nippon and remain in the United States headquartered in Pittsburgh and it's going to create
70,000 jobs and add 15 or 14 billion to the economy that sounds good sounds good
we're going to have more steel and fewer Chinese students now I do worry
that some of the foreign students would be you know highly value added to our
tax situation in this country but I do think we got a lot of them so maybe we
could have fewer well Texas has decided uh it's on
the verge of it hasn't done it yet of completely banning THC
products and so Tim Walsh governor of
Minneapolis Minnesota um governor of
Minnesota right uh so Tim Walsh weighs in because
Texas might ban THC and he says in a post on X "Texans flee the nanny state
and come up north to enjoy the land of the free." And I'm thinking to myself Tim Walsh just came out publicly
in in favor of smoking weed in an estate
okay I I like him a little bit better now he's got that one thing going for
him well according to John Balden there's no such thing as a South African
white genocide um and he uh apparently you know that
video of the uh what we were told is these South Africans singing "Kill the
farmers kill the you know shoot the Africaners." And it was one of the main pieces of evidence that Trump was
showing the president of South Africa apparently those were not even
South Africans it was video from the Republic of the Congo
now that's what Reuters is saying um there was a clip grabbed from
Reuters and it wasn't even South Africans but I do wonder if there are
any South Africans who are doing that that song and that dance but I don't I I
don't know what to believe about South Africa anymore so John Balden basically says you know
there's just so much crime there and you know murder that of course the white
farmers are getting murdered because everybody's getting murdered they're they're just part of the getting
murdered crowd but they're not they're not specifically being targeted i don't
know about that so John Balden is not exactly the best source for really anything
uh he's usually wrong on all the important everything
but I if the white South Africans believe there's a genocide wouldn't they be the best
source that are they're not making it up right the the ones who want to get out
of there because it's too dangerous seems like it's unlikely that
it's fake well David Hog you know him the co-chair
of the DNC he's uh he says that Representative Jasmine Crockett is a type of leader
that they need because the Democratic party is rudderless rudderless
h rudder would be the thing that dangles down under the boat you know what they are is
they they are rudderless but they're also penisless and
scrotumless um but David Hog says "I love her she's
amazing i think that people want to see somebody who fights and calls out the
bull the BS ultimately." Uh he was talking to Charlemagne the god i think that's what
Jasmine does do you think he's uh called it right do you think he's got his finger
on the pulse do you think what the Democrats need more than anything is a angry black
woman who can yell yell a lot or or is he just being a sort of a
DEI guy and he wants to make sure he's he's backing her i feel like Jasmine Crockett is what
the Republicans want for the Democrats she might be the worst
spokesperson that the Democrats have ever had and I love the fact that David Hog has to embrace her oh well good luck
with that guys according to the conversation
um and this is based on some Australians I think oh wait yeah uh authors are not
happy about AI using their work even if they get paid so I guess a bunch of uh
Australian authors have weighed in and they don't like at all the AI might be
trained on their work um now does that surprise
you uh so I went to Grock and I said "Grock are are the uh sales of
non-fiction books going down since AI?" Because that would be the way you'd know
um if people felt they didn't read need to read non-fiction books because they could just ask Grock and it it's already
read all the books and Grock was very very
vague you know Grock was a little bit well you know there is a little bit of a
decrease in that market but you can't really tie that to AI because you have
lots of different factors happening to which I thought oh my god is AI covering
its own tracks it looks like AI is coming up with its own alibis well you know it's
not the AI it's a variety of factors that would be hard to
measure i don't [Music] know i'm going to say that that's an
open question but here's my prediction my
prediction is that non-fiction books will continue to decrease in sales and
it will be because of AI eventually all right well it's a holiday weekend
there's not much going on so can anybody tell me if uh the
Xplatform is working can you give me an update in the comments i know it's
there'll be a little time lag here but uh is the Xplatform
working because if it is then Owen can do his spaces cuz there's not much going
on today uh I I I probably have a little less content today because a lot of it
comes from X oh it's not working erica says "Damn
it." So Owen does that mean you won't be trying to do a
spaces cuz I doubt the spaces would work if the platform's down all right well um
if it's not working today Owen says he'll move it to tomorrow um but I'm hear I'm seeing uh
authoritatively that it's glitching
okay uh Owen says he'll give it a shot and see how it goes all right so he's
going to give it a shot and uh I'm going to end early because there's not much going on
but uh you can go to Owen spaces and if it works you can get a lot more and thanks
for joining everybody um I'm going to say a few words to the locals people privately but for
the rest of you enjoy your Saturday
