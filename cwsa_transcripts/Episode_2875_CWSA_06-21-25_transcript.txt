and happy Saturday everybody we've got a podcast for you like you've
never seen before borrowing uh Trump's sayings nobody's
ever seen anything like it it would be the best thing ever in the
entire world probably
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if you'd like to try and I say try to take
it up to levels that nobody can even understand with their tiny shiny human
brains all you need for that is a copper micro glass tanker Charles a
canteen joker flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like
coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the dopamine day of the day the thing that makes
everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it happens now go
oh that's good there's only one thing that could make it better mr trump would you like a sip we are
going to drain the swamp in Washington DC go
there he is draining the swamp all right
so there's some fun science coming up oh by the way um although today is Saturday
there will not be a spaces event um after the show that will be tomorrow so
tomorrow on Sunday Owen Gregorian will have his spaces event after the show
well according to the ex account uh creme
if I'm pronouncing that correctly and I'm not uh apparently there's a good chance that
type 1 diabetes has been cured i don't know maybe type 1 diabetes so
apparently um over the last year there was a test where 12 diabetics were
injected with a stem cell derived pancreatic islets
and I was going to say have they never tried injecting stem cell derived
pancreatic islets before but they did now they tried it and uh apparently
people started producing insulin again and 10 out of 12 participants
after one year no longer needed to inject insulin whoa how about that
imagine that imagine that you were alive could be
maybe not for sure when type 1 diabetes was cured wouldn't that be awesome
in other news uh there's a
what's being called a groundbreaking study uh that says eating one avocado a
day could help you sleep better with all of the health benefits of extra sleep um
let's see who did the study oh uh it's according to the HOS avocado board
so it's being reported by the Hos avocado people that eating one avocado a
day can help you sleep better well I eat one avocado a day and I do sleep pretty
well so I call that science
um I don't know who funded that study but uh I'm not I'm not sure the hos
avocado people are the the ones to believe
um here's another science thing we'll talk about Iran of course um apparently
according to the American Society for Metabolic and Beriatric Surgery the
people who have the uh weight loss surgery I guess that's the one where they talk to your stomach um they have a
self-esteem improvement of 131%
so is there any way they could have saved some money in that study hm h I
wonder um suppose they ask me Scott
uh do you think that being in shape and eating right and going to the gym um
will that help your mental and physical health and your happiness and your
chances of success yes yes there's never an exception
eating right and exercising absolutely will make you happier and
healthier and more successful guarantee it so next time just ask me i'm here just
ask um apparently uh President Trump is uh
going back and forth on his his ideas about deporting farm workers
because he's quite aware that if he departs all the uh the noncitizen farm
workers we will starve to death because it might take a while to replace
them with American workers if we even can and but here here's my favorite part
about this story um remember how I always tell you that Trump is he finds
it impossible to be boring everything he says has that that little
bit of edge to it that makes you read it twice and he did it again with the the
farm worker deportation so here's a Trump quote
quote "I never want to hurt our farmers our farmers are great people they keep
us happy healthy and fat
trump is the only person uh well the only president who would throw fat into
the end of that sentence they keep us happy and healthy and fat
i can't tell you how many times I reread the sentence and that's what Trump does to you he just makes you reread the
sentence you know five times and laugh every time why would you even do that
he's the only person who can make that sentence interesting
well speaking of Trump as you know um the Trump family has has
announced that they plan to go into the mobile phone business um and
they actually plan to make the smartphone in the United States now the
people who know how to make smartphones are very insistent that that's not
possible that it would take I don't know years and years to figure out how to
train Americans to make phones and how to get all the infrastructure and
technology here and factories but uh so far the uh I think Don Jr has
said that he plans to make it in the United States so
do they know something that we don't know is there a secret plan where they
can take a I don't know a Taiwanese or Chinese company and just move it over
here and make those phones in America or
as some some are suggesting this is not a real business that it might be more
for PR or something I don't know but it doesn't seem to me that Don Jr would be
involved in a totally makebelieve business he must have some kind of plan
to make these phones in the United States but we don't know what that is so
maybe we'll be surprised well uh AI is our David Saxs
um is very pro AI as you might imagine and he says that AI will be bigger than
the iPhone bigger than the internet and it's going to fuel the growth of the
American economy for years to come and would be one of the most important parts
of Trump's legacy now uh Saxs also said
separately on a post.x X that AI might be adding jobs
um and not subtracting now of course that would be a controversial opinion because for sure
there are jobs that will go away but also for sure there will be jobs
that will be created for example um over on Tik Tok there are a whole bunch of
people using AI to get rich making viral videos that are actually quite
entertaining i like the ones of the uh the cute little kittens who work at
McDonald's if you haven't seen that one it's pretty awesome or the uh the cats were doing
Olympic diving off a diving board so the AI is pretty good now pretty good
now those are special cases you know it's not like we're all going to be making AI content but I do think that
Sachs might be closer to accurate when he says that AI might add jobs they'll
just be completely different jobs than we've ever had or they'll be the same job but one person can do a much better
job of it perhaps so you got that going on
um I heard also some other famous investor say that the the big investment
for the future is AI and if you're not invested in AI
um you're going to feel bad about it so uh I don't give uh investment advice
but you should know that some investors are saying that AI is the place to the
place to be well more to that point um the CEO of OpenAI Sam Alman
um he did a podcast I think with his brother and he mentioned that uh Meta is
offering a$100 million bonus for the top Open AI employees to leave OpenAI and go
work for Meta $100 million
just a bonus so that's not even counting their their pay that's just a bonus
does that sound real it doesn't really sound real to me but I
don't think he'd make it up it'd be a weird thing to make up so I don't know i
have some trouble believing that uh that's true it might be true of you know
three people in the world you know the the smartest AI people maybe they are worth 100 million i don't know but uh
I've decided to uh quit my job as a cartoonist and become a AI specialist
try to get that $100 million bonus i'll let you know how that goes
in other AI news according to neuroscience news
uh researchers have figured out how to get AI to um be more empathetic and work
on your emotions so they can tailor emotional analogies to each user's
personality and life experience so notice how they use analogies they
use analogies to get empathy and to work on your emotions
and boy that's dangerous it might be you know it's inevitable the
AI will learn to manipulate the emotions of humans you know there's no way to
stop that from happening but uh here it is and I guess the big takeaway is that
you can't use the same analogy for every person you have to have the analogy tailored for their personality but once
you do that you can manipulate their feelings and once AI can manipulate our
feelings who will be in charge well AI
because once AI can give you better information than you had
but then can also manipulate you with analogies and stories and anecdotes
well then it pretty much is going to run everything
so that's coming um and also according to the Verge Sarah Parker is writing
about this apparently people use chat GPT a lot their vocabulary starts to
change and this one is fun this is this one I did not see coming apparently even
though um AI is based on actual human conversations and interactions
there are different vocabulary words that come up more in AI than they come
up in normal conversation so apparently words like delve
are are words that AI would use more likely than you would when was the last
time you used the word delve as in we're going to delve into that
i I was wondering I was thinking I don't know if I've ever used that word in
conversation i've read it i've heard people say it
but I don't know if I've ever used it even once you know I I would say let's
dig into it or you know let's do a deeper dive but I don't think I maybe
I've never used that word but apparently people use AI and chat GPT in particular
they'll they'll start saying words like uh uh let's see prowess and tapestry
i guess those come up a lot in Chad GPT and they're less likely to use words
like bolster unearth and nuance because chap doesn't use them as much so here's
the hypnotist take on the story
as a hypnotist I can tell you that the choice of words can influence what you think about the
topic so it's not a you know just a mere curiosity that
people use AI use different vocabulary that specific vocabulary is very likely
to to change how you think about the topic and you wouldn't know why
so that's the hypnotist take the specific choice of words that you
associate with a topic very much will influence your overall
opinion of the topic and if you were to just force somebody to use a different
vocabulary and in this case you know how to force them it's happening naturally
they would think differently about the topic depending on the topic so now AI
can influence us by which vocabulary we use but it can also influence us by
being very useful so we rely on it for facts even if they're wrong and
apparently it can also influence us with analogies and emotion and empathy
so if you were wondering is AI going to start being in control of humans yeah
yeah no doubt about it there there isn't the slightest chance that AI will not be
influencing what you think about stuff now the interesting thing
is will this cause any kind of uh unity so right now the country is divided you
know by politics what would happen if AI all the AIs start converging on the same
explanation of things and use the same analogies and have similar vocabulary
is it possible that our diverse opinions will merge into one opinion that
coincidentally or not is exactly what AI would tell you is true
that might happen so one possibility is AI manipulates us and turns us into
mindless puppets and we don't know it uh the other possibility is it allows us to
stop fighting with each other because we can all just look at AI and go "Oh all
right i guess that's the partake." And then we just agree with it so could be
good never know um
according to uh Trump the US has arranged a treaty some kind of a peace
treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda
now raise your hand if you knew that the Republic of Congo and Republic of Rwanda
were in some kind of a war h I have to admit that although I do
know the number of people who live in Iran 92 million I did not know anything
about the Republic of Condo or Rwanda however according to the post millennial
um Trump is uh is bragging that the US got that done and if we did good job
marco Rubio and looks like they may have been instrumental in that
uh but Trump being Trump and as I already noted it's impossible for him to
say something that's boring instead of just saying "Hey good news we've got
this peace deal we've got this new peace deal that was really necessary." Instead of doing that
he announces it and at the same time in the same message he complains that he probably won't get a Nobel Peace Prize
for his work with India and Pakistan his work with Serbia and Kosovo i don't even
know what that was egypt and Ethiopia again I have no idea what that was about
does anybody know what Trump did to make things better between Egypt and Ethiopia
i do not and then he also mentions the Abraham Accords as all the things he's done for
peace and uh but he won't get a Nobel Peace Prize because that only goes to
liberals he says and he says that even if he were to end the war in Ukraine and
uh get a good result in Iran even if he could do that he says he'll never get
the Nobel Peace Prize now do you recognize what form of uh
persuasion he's using this is not random
this is really good persuasion because he keeps saying that he won't get the Nobel Peace Prize
what do I teach you about negatives this is another hypnotist trick um
the hypnotist trick is that the more you make people think Nobel Peace Prize and
peace prize for this i won't get the Nobel Peace Prize for this and your brain doesn't hear the won't it it sort
of forgets it right away and all you can think of is Trump and Nobel Peace Prize
so it's actually a super clever way of increasing the odds that he gets a Nobel
Peace Prize which to me is hilarious it's hilarious that he's working on it like he actually
is trying to get one i kind of I kind of love that all right
well as you know the news is never complete without some stories about Elon Musk today is no exception and
apparently uh Elon Musk scolded Grock his own his own AI uh because Grock said
that used sources Media Matters and Rolling Stone to uh dispute something
said by ex user Cat Turd 2
and apparently uh and so Musk responded to Grock on the Xplatform like he was
talking to a person and he said to Grock "Your sourcing is terrible only a very
dumb AI would believe media banners and Rolling Stone you were being updated
this week." So so Musk is having a conversation with
his own AI and scolding it and saying that it's using bad sources and he's going to fix it
now that's funny well speaking of Elon Musk apparently
Tesla according to CNBC is just signed a deal with China to
build their largest gridscale battery power plant
um now I think the the batteries are also made in China but uh the it's a yeah
they've got a battery factory in Shanghai and it's made over a 100 megaps
in the first quarter so what this is about is a way to make your network more
efficient because you can store the uh cheaply cheaply generated electricity in your
batteries and then release them as you need them and uh China will be first now
I don't make um I don't give financial advice
but if you knew that Tesla just signed a enormous deal to create a gridcale
battery power plants in China and they're planning to do it for other countries as well isn't that one of the
biggest businesses in the world i mean it's starting you know it's starting
with one but wouldn't every every power
grid want this so what is what is exactly the size of
this financial opportunity it looks like it's bigger than cars I mean uh
literally every country and every grid would probably get some benefit from
having a battery you know a battery uh power land anyway
um according to Politico and uh Carrie Lake was announcing this
as her in her role as a a advisor to President Trump apparently a majority of
the staff of Voice of America is getting released terminated
and uh what is uh senior presidential advisor
Carrie Lake said "Today we took decisive actions to effectuate." Effectuate
there's a word that I don't use effectuate when was the last time you used
effectuate in a sentence um I would say I've never used it once
uh this is the first time I've ever said that word out loud effectuate
um the Trump agenda to shrink the control federal bureaucracy so we'll see
if that sticks eliminating 1,400 jobs and 85% cut to the workforce there good
job all right as I've said before um pundit
and humorist comic Dave Smith has uh very
let's say effectively and impressively worked his way into the conversation
about the biggest topics in America in this case the Israel Iran conflict and
I'm very impressed because you know it'd be one thing if you were a famous geopolitical expert
but to become one of the central people in the conversation coming out of the humor field you know
the the podcast punditry world you really have to be doing something
well and even if you disagree with him and I'm gonna disagree with him a little bit
today even if you disagree I really like what he adds to the conversation
because he does sort of force people to debate him and you know you can judge
for yourself who's got the better opinion but uh I like where he takes the
conversations but he had a uh a post that actually got millions of uh views
and I will read it to you his post was "Okay fine iran doesn't have nukes but
have you heard their chance we must go to war to stop these chants."
Now that's a pretty good humorist take
but is there any more to this story of course there is so here's here's my take
and he may have he may have already answered this i don't know but I weighed in on that
and I said in the comments I haven't heard an innocent reason why Iran
insists on threshold enrichment levels threshold meaning right up to the point
where you can make a nuclear weapon uh and there's no reason to be there at
that level of enrichment there there's not a civilian use for it the only use
for it is if you want to be poised to very quickly make a nuclear weapon now
that's as far as I know there may be some expert who says "But Scott you
idiot don't you know that getting to 60% enrichment is just you know useful for
this or that?" Well I don't know i haven't heard that i I've not heard that argument now the other thing you need to
know is that getting from 60% to 90% which is where you need to be for
a bomb I understand is not a question of getting from 60 to 90 apparently the uh
enrichment process has a logarithmic kind of quality to it so that 60 is
right next to 90 so if you can get to 60
then getting to 90 might take three weeks that's that's my understanding but I you know I could be wrong about that
but I think that's right so has anybody heard Iran give any kind of public
explanation of why they would need to increase their their enrichment to the point where
there's only one reason that I know of which is to be ready to make a nuclear
weapon now you add that to the fact that they've been funding proxies to try to
destroy you know Israel for a long time and uh they've done a number of
terrorist acts against Americans in the area over the years and then on top of that they have this uh this chant about
death to Israel and death to America now I would agree that if the only problem
was their chanting I would not be so worried but if you combine death to America death to Israel
with building a enrichment capacity which only has one purpose and a history
of funding proxies to attack Israel
that looks pretty aggressive to me that that looks like more than a chant so
um I went online and said a few things about the Israel situation and what I found was that if you say anything that
um people disagree with on this topic you will be called anti-semitic
so I I got called anti-semitic for I think just asking some question online
and somebody said "Whoa why would you do that why would you even question that unless you're anti-Semitic to which I
say "Oh you just you i'm not anti-semitic
if I have questions about why we're doing what we're doing and how we're doing it that has nothing to do with any
kind of anti-semitism these are you know three countries that
are in this situation and if I talk about it it's because I'm trying to
understand it or predict it there's no deeper no deeper meaning um
and then there are the people who say that essentially Israel and Iran are sort of
morally and ethically similar now that's the the mode I don't want to
get into because once you get into the moral ethical part you're you know you
just have to take a side and I don't want to do that but I would point out that it seems very unlikely
if Iran decided to be totally you know peaceful and not make any threats or any
threatening moves toward its neighbors it seems deeply unlikely that Israel would attack them wouldn't you say but
would that be the same if Israel decided to be totally peaceful would they be
attacked by Iran or Iranian proxies well it doesn't look like those are the
same to me to me it looks like Iran has a long-term goal to erase Israel at
least as a country uh off the map
i I don't see that Israel has any kind of goal like that as far as I know they
would love to probably have some kind of regime change that loved Israel but you
know what are the odds of that pretty low so
any uh comparison of the two seems out of place to me
uh meanwhile the National Review the conservative publication in this country
is attacking uh what they call skeptics of the Iraq war and they've got a new uh
updated article uh calling them unpatriotic conservatives
um oh that's what they called the people who were against the Iraq war but now they're using it to to go against the
people who are against the you know the attack of Iran
so it makes you wonder what is the National Review
is the job of the National Review news or opinion
or do they work for the uh military-industrial complex and it's
just their way of influencing the country it makes me wonder what exactly
is the National Review well as you know uh Trump has said that
he's going to give uh well before I get to that there there are two stories about two weeks the first story about
two weeks is that Israel said they thought that they would be done with
their war in two weeks now when uh people like me talk about
international geopolitical stuff the first thing you probably say to yourself is "What the hell does he know about
geopolitical anything does he even know the population of Iran?" Yes I do 92
million um but uh wouldn't you imagine that my
opinion about the Israel Iran situation should be kind of worthless because I
have no experience in that domain you know no special knowledge i haven't been
there so wouldn't you just sort of automatically assume that I would be
wrong about everything unless I just got lucky
well let's uh keep track because I have made some specific public uh predictions
one of my predictions is that there was no way that Israel would be done in two weeks how am I doing so far
well if uh Trump's two weeks is if they keep to Trump's two weeks and he he says
that's a maximum so there's some there's some chance that Trump will act before
the two weeks is over but I think that's low it'll at least be 3 weeks
but on top of that um there is a uh military commander um
who says that uh he said it's going to take longer he
says uh difficult days still lie ahead and that Israel must be ready for a
quote prolonged campaign so that that's coming from Israel so Israel it looks
like has already abandoned their two week estimate
so did you see anybody else um say that the two weeks were would probably be
 i didn't I did not see one expert say "I
don't think this will be done in two weeks it might take months." Only me now did I use my geopolitical
expertise no i used the Dilbert filter the Dilbert filter works whenever
there's any big complicated human endeavor and nobody ever got anything done in two
weeks two weeks for a war come on who Who ever believed that that
was going to get done in two weeks so here's an example
where I don't have any geopolitical you know uh experience whatsoever
but that that kind of stood out as a glaring obvious point that you could
question how many of you said the same thing said "All right there's no way this is going to be done in two weeks."
Because nothing is nothing is ever done in two weeks no matter no matter how
sure you are that it can be it just never is so I got that one right anyway
so Trump says he's going to give Iran a couple of weeks um some say that's
mostly so he can move some more assets into place like naval assets etc in case
we need to go hard apparently there's reports that several B2 uh stealth
bombers have already taken off um and they're going from Missouri to Guam
now presumably that would get them closer to the theater that they might be used in and this would be an indication
that Trump has either u decided he's going to attack or wants Iran to think
that that's a strong possibility and
um some say that the two weeks that Trump is giving is just to see if
anything changes in a favorable way so for example if Israel had let's say some
unexpectedly big successes in the next two weeks that change the equation
well then you're going to be you know you're going to be glad that Trump waited because maybe we don't have to
attack so what could happen in those two weeks besides getting more military
assets in place um some people say that Thran might
abandon its uh nuclear program i don't think that's going to happen so
expecting them to tell the Europeans you know we don't want to talk to America or
Israel but we'd be happy to abandon our enrichment program
that's not going to happen i don't see Iran bending to the will of the West
um so we've got this twoe period and Trump in his usual way says it's a
maximum so that it it keeps them guessing that they they they won't get too comfortable for two weeks because
maybe just maybe something will happen faster now the big question is should
the United States be involved in taking out the Ford and maybe one other
underground bunker facility uh under the belief that only America
has the weapons that can do that and that would be the bunker busters that
they say would have to be double hold so you would have to use one to make a big
hole and then drop another one in the same hole to get deeper
and the American weapon makers and the military-industrial complex is telling
us via the news oh this will definitely work now there's a question of whether
we should do it but the people who make the weapons and talk about the weapons
and know the most about the weapons which is not me right so again here here's another situation where I do not
have any knowledge of militaryindustrial complex i do not know anything about
bunker busters or anything about these uh B2 stealth bombers
so coming from no knowledge whatsoever and being in the same conversation with
people who are geopolitical military experts let me put the Dilbert filter on
this nobody knows if those bombs will work
are you kidding me let let me take you to the real world for a moment
they've never tested dropping two bunker busters in the same hole they do not
know exactly what is you know inside that Fordau mountain and just exactly how things are
protected in there they might know a lot but they don't know everything
when was the last time you saw somebody do this a complicated thing that had
never been done before and it worked out perfectly and they knew it in advance
that's not a function of the real world in the real world you'd be really lucky
if you got this to work on the first try and I don't know if there'll be more than one try
so the first thing I'm going to say without being any kind of a military expert is that probably everybody lies
about how powerful their weapons are uh were you ever surprised when you
heard that the Iron Dome or or some version of the Iron Dome was not not
stopping all the missiles and somebody probably told you oh yeah the
anti-missile defense is going to get 98% of the missiles and then it turns out
maybe it gets 90% but 10%'s a lot of missiles to let through so I would say
that whenever you hear somebody say that a a weapon system will definitely work
really in the real world in the real world you've never used it in this way
and but you're sure it's going to work all right so we're not sure it's going to work and and you should not imagine
that that anybody knows that with certainty whether it'll work now I don't
know the odds if you said "Well what are the odds that it doesn't work?" I don't
know but nobody else knows either the only thing I know for sure is it's not a
definite if it were definite that might change the equation a little bit but it's not
it's not definite and just to make things interesting
uh Netanyahu has said publicly that Israel can take care of the Iranian nuclear program without America's help
if they have to now are you all aware of that i'll I'll
take a fact check on that if I'm wrong but correct me if I'm wrong um Netanyahu
has recently publicly said that they don't need America's
involvement they could take care of it in a different way they don't have these bunker busters but there might be some
way to do something on the ground or you know with with special forces or something now would that put would that
put Israel in a position of taking um losses yes of course that's what military
conflicts do they put you in a position where where people could be killed on your side
um but that does settle the question in my mind of whether Trump should um
authorize the the B the B2 bombers to drop the bunker busters and the answer
is no if if Israel says that they can handle
it without us why would we even consider it now you would consider it if our
involvement made it a guarantee that it would work and Israel couldn't do it by
itself but that's not the case our bunker busters are anything but
guaranteed and Israel says they can do it
why wouldn't we at least wait two weeks to see if they can do it is it possible
that Trump's two weeks is really waiting to see if Israel can make a dent at
Forau with some kind of different strategy uh and you could imagine I
won't I won't mention any that I could think of because I'm not smart enough but there might be some way to get a
hold of whoever it is who has the the lock to open the front door
don't you think there's probably more than one person in the world who knows
how to open that door is it is it a combination lock
is it a multi-step process where the people inside the facility have to be
the ones to unlock it from the inside is that how it works i'm just speculating
but don't you think there's some chance that Israel could get a hold of whoever
has the key or the combination or the secret you know digital way to open that
thing maybe there's just a way to open the front door that that we don't know
about maybe Israel knows more about that because they're they're pretty deeply you know into the pants of the of the
Iranian everything maybe they know but anyway so the alternative
the alternative to Israel doing it themselves and believing that they can
do it themselves is that Israel um went
into the war knowing that they could not succeed without American involvement in
the war now that would be much worse wouldn't you think
and when I asked that question online on X I said "When did Israel know that they
couldn't do this alone?" Now of course they say that they can do it alone so
that would be new information from when I asked the question so isn't it way worse
if Israel tried to trick the United States into getting involved by getting
us a little bit pregnant than saying "Well we got to this point but the only way we can finish it is by getting
America involved directly more directly in the war." So I would say this made the decision
for Trump kind of easy because if Israel says they can do it
and then he authorizes the United States to be involved in the war and then Iran
attacks our homeland takes off our turns off our lights with cyber attacks and uh
starts killing people in bases in the Middle East Americans that's going to look like a failure
right so you know that would be some somewhat of an unforgivable mistake but more than
that it would be an admission that Israel is wagging Trump's tail
meaning that it would suggest that the only way we got into this situation is
that Israel knew that if they started the war they could drag us in to finish
it off now I don't want to believe that about Netanyahu so I'm going to take him at his word
that I believe he said and I'll I'll take your fact check if I'm wrong about this but if they think they have a way
to do it even if they don't know that it will work they have to try that first
so to me the decision is already made
it it's really hard for me to imagine that Trump would allow a situation where
history would say Netanyahu tricked him into a war
just just think about think about Trump's personality think about his you know decades of
being anti-war and then think about the prospect of
being treated by history as though you got tricked into a war
by your own ally there's no way he's going to allow that situation
so as long as Netanyahu has said publicly we could probably take care of this ourselves he has to let them
and I would say that any other decision would look like a mistake and history
would judge him harshly for it now what would happen if Israel tried and they
lost some troops and they did not succeed and then they gave up well then
that's a separate decision from that point you can say "All right new
information it turns out that Israel can't do it alone because they tried."
But I'll tell you the one thing that we're not going to be able to live with
we're not going to be able to live with Netanyahu saying he can do it and not letting him see if he can
there there's no way we're going to live with that and there's no way that Trump's legacy could survive uh getting
involved when it doesn't seem necessary according to Israel and they would know
more about the situation that we would so
uh I'm sure I will be called anti-semitic for for taking Netanyahu
and his word that he can do this but if I have that wrong if I've misinterpreted
what he said let me know because that would change my opinion a little bit all right
um Matt Gates floated a uh plan now I
don't think this one has any chance of happening but it's interesting um
nonetheless so he suggests that uh both Iran and Israel give up their uh secret
nuclear weapon programs now I don't think there's any chance
that Israel is going to give up its secret nuclear weapon triad because it's
probably pretty advanced and it would be insane to give it up I
guess um but it does make you wonder
um is that one of the possibilities what would Iran say if Israel offered to
legitimately get rid of its uh nuclear program
would Iran say "Oh well I never thought that would happen." All right if you're going to do it we can do it too would
they um I don't think that that topic can even be broached because even if Israel
put it out there as a suggested idea it would be an acknowledgement that they
have the secret nuclear nuclear triad that we all assume that they have so I don't think there's any
way that could work but it does make you wonder
does make you think anyway um Tulsa Gabbard is of course
under attack by the people who say uh that she disagrees with Trump and Trump
said that she was wrong if she said that uh Iran couldn't make a a bomb so I
think my first take on this early in the early on the drama was right that when
Tulsi Gabbard was talking about Iran she was talking about a decision to make a
bomb and she said that the um the intelligence people in the United States
have not detected that the Ayatollah has decided to make a nuclear weapon
whereas when Trump talks about it he talks about the ability to make a
nuclear weapon so if they walk right up to the threshold and they are enriching
uranium to the point where there's no other legitimate reason to do it other than your intention to make a weapon
well that would put Trump in the position of saying it almost doesn't matter
what anybody has decided if they've walked up to the line where they can do it in three weeks you have to treat it
like they're doing it it's the same so I don't see any difference between what
Tulsi Gabbard said and what Trump says to me they look like they're completely
compatible they both would agree that Iran could do it fairly quickly so
they're agreed on that and I don't think Trump has said that the Ayatollah has
been detected as ordering it to be done he's not saying that
he's just being a common sense person who says if they say death to America
and they've been funding proxies and they they go right up to the threshold
what else would they have in mind you'd have to treat that like their intention
is obvious so even if you don't know their intention and you can't read their
mind uh Trump is right you'd have to treat it as though you could read their mind and
they do have the intention even if you don't know for sure anyway um here's a correction that uh I
got a story completely wrong and uh Glenn Greenwald is correcting people
like me the story was that the Washington Post has a reporter he used to work for El
Jazer which is part of the smearing of his reputation he used to work for El
Jazer but now he's on the Washington Post and when he reports about the
missile damage in Israel he was giving um actual coordinates like GPS
coordinates of where the damage was and Bill Aman and a number of other people
and including me um in my podcast were saying "Why would you do that?" Like
what possible reason would you want Iran to have the GPS coordinates of the
missile attack unless you were hoping they could improve their aim because if you tell them where they
landed maybe they can adjust their their process somehow now that made sense to
me when I said it but let me tell you how stupid that was
all right so here here's a case where if I knew more I would have done a better job
as Glenn Greenwald points out here's the most important part of the story the the
I'm laughing at myself for what an idiot I am because this is really dumb
uh where do you think the reporter got the GPS coordinates for the missile
damage do you think he was over there no he's not over there he's in the United
States so how did he get the the missile coordinates of where the bombs hit
it's public it's public
so Iran would obviously already know what this reporter knows because it's
public so he used a public source for the GPS coordinates which Iran has full
access to and if that's not enough for you
apparently the same reporter has been doing the same thing reporting the GPS
coordinates for prior wars i think at least two prior wars and the reason he
does it is so that um if you wanted to check basically it would allow you to
have a way to check to see if the reporting is accurate um he gives us the
GPS coordinates so if somebody looked at it from let's say a satellite and they saw that that building was intact they
could say "Oh the reporting was wrong." So it's basically a way to let other
people check his work so um I would like to apologize
for getting that story absolutely wrong just absolutely basswards
and uh the journalist is Evan Hill so I I will apologize to him directly so
Evan sorry about that uh I I got taken by that that hoax
anyway uh this is why uh
this is why you want to listen to uh Greenwald he he always has the better take on
stuff um apparently the uh Trump administration
is making some big changes to Obamacare and they're ending uh coverage for
dreamers so the dreamers would be the children who are brought in by their
parents and have grown up as Americans uh but they're not technically legal
so apparently they're going to lose their Obamacare coverage
um and my question is this do you think that the um Trump
administration is using the cover of the Israel Iran war to get away with some
things that otherwise it would be too much public push back for because this
is in the area that you know a reasonable person could disagree
because you're talking about you know people who did not make any decision to
come here they were brought here by their parents and they would be losing healthcare
now there's an argument on both sides i get it i get it you don't have to you
don't have to argue with me i I see the argument but do you think do you think
Trump could get away with this without there being some big international story that dominates
i feel like I feel like the uh the Steven Millers have a little more
flexibility because we're distracted by other things that seem like a bigger deal to us so that's my only comment on
that i wonder if distraction is making a difference
well Bill Maher had uh Wesley Hunt on who's a representative and uh Wesley Hunt did a
unusually good job of slapping down Bill Maher's TDS
um so the first thing that uh that happened was uh Bill Maher was talking
about Trump's military parade um and he he mentioned that it was a fascist
parade and Wesley Hunt said this you know what
I saw uh this is what Han said i saw the president salute the core of cadetses as
they walked past them i watched them salute the 75th Ranger Regiment um I
watched the fireworks behind the Washington Monument and you know what I thought damn that's
absolutely outstanding and it's far better than Joe Biden checking his watch when bodies were being returned to do
and then he reminds us that he was in the military he was an
Apache pilot and he joined the military because of in part because of that type
of patriotic treatment of the military now that's a pretty darn good answer
it's a fascist military and then the person who actually served talking to
Bill Maher who did not serve in the military says "No it wasn't fascist it's the reason I joined the military."
That is a really good answer now but he had another chance to slap down Bill
Maher um because Bill Maher referred to January 6 as an insurrection
and uh as his proof Bill Maher said you know it's not a coincidence that they
were protesting at the exact time the votes were being I think he said counted
but maybe certified was a better word now uh Wesley Hunt said uh "How do you
have an insurrection with no guns?" There you go how do you have an
insurrection with no guns why did it take this long for somebody to say that
on Bill Maher show how many times has Bill Maher referred to January 6 as an
insurrection and it took all the way to now
for Wesley Hunt to say "How do you have an insurrection with no guns?"
He went on saying "That's like making coffee with no beans."
One person was killed that day it was Ashley Babbot she was a white unarmed
woman killed by a black Capitol police officer imagine if that had been the other way around ouch oh you're good
Wesley Hunt um and then Mara tried to argue it but um
Wesley pointed out that the summer of love was way more dangerous and more people died and it was way worse um I
would I would have added one thing so that was that was a good comeback
but I would add this bill Maher does not understand
what the protesters were thinking when they protested if what they were
thinking was I know we lost this election but we're going to try to take
over the country and install our our beloved Trump if that's what they were
thinking then that was an insurrection even without the guns that would be an
insurrection but they weren't i'll bet you couldn't find even one person out and of the
thousands of people I'll bet you wouldn't find one who said "I knew Trump
lost but I wanted him to be president anyway." I'll bet not one so the entire
argument that January 6 was an insurrection depends entirely on the
mental state of the protesters if what they believed is that the
election itself was obviously corrupt because of the the weird oddities of
that election you know the the sudden surge of Biden the the unusual number of
votes he got compared to Obama and compared to other years and then the uh
the uh what do you call it the the certain districts the bellweather
districts um I think 13 or 14 went the wrong way you know they're they're
normally the most predictive thing in our elections and they all predicted that Trump won and he still lost
so if you ask those people I'm pretty sure they would say "We think that the
election didn't look like it was necessarily fair and we wanted them to
pause just to look into it a little bit just just to make sure that the right
person won." How in the world does Bill Maher who
talks about politics for a living not realize that he's never heard from anybody who was involved in the protest
and that that's the only thing that matters what were they thinking and were
they thinking that they were taking over the country and they left their guns home
is that what they were thinking so I think Wesley Hunt um he he was 60% of
the way there with you know nobody nobody goes to a insurrection without
guns but the other 40% that's a kill shot and nobody's taken a
kill shot yet it's going to happen but nobody's done it yet
new York Post is reporting that CNN is collapsing uh two of their executives
just uh resigned uh vice president of domestic news and VP of digital video
and they'd both been there a long time and I guess there are big cost cutings coming and
uh Anderson Cooper gets paid $18 million a year i've got a feeling that there might be a
change coming to Anderson Cooper's compensation package but we'll see
um according to a post I saw by Mario Noel
who you should follow on X he has great news summaries um he saw this in the CTU
UCB cyber security research so that he has a source apparently 500 research
papers have been written uh in China about how to crash the power grid in
America so um 367
Chinese papers targeting the US grids and 166 on European systems and they
talked about how to create quote cascading failures and systematic
collapse so if you're wondering
is China wondering how to collapse our entire um power network the answer is
yes they're putting a lot of effort into understanding what would work
now the fact that there are so many different papers sort of suggests that maybe there's not
one obvious way to do it which maybe gives me a little weird comfort if if
they have to do that much thinking about it maybe it's not easy you know may
maybe they can't just turn a switch which we imagine they could do
but uh the papers detail quote malicious data injection attacks yikes
what would uh keep China from attacking our grid
well I think as long as we don't attack their grid or attack them
um it's unlikely they're going to attack us in that way because why would they but as a defensive move
um China quite wisely has a pretty good backup plan
and I have to admit it I feel safer if China feels they can take down our
electric grid than I would if the only tool they had was a nuclear weapon
because taking down the power grid would kill a lot of people and it would be you
know massively disruptive and horrible um but nuclear war would be worse so
maybe it's good that they have some kind of halfway thing that they can do obviously we're Yeah I'm sure America
has looked into the same same question for their grid
well the uh Postmillennials reporting that uh Representative Jerry Nadler
um is accusing ICE agents of hiding misbehavior by wearing masks
now apparently the Democrats have decided on another 20% issue
how many people in the United States think that they want the ICE agents to
reveal their identity to the the gangs you know MS13 and Trenagua
how many people think that's a good idea now I understand that the you know
regular cops on the street don't wear masks and I'm happy about that but
apparently according to Breitbart um there's a recent analysis and the
Department of Homeland Security sees a 500% increase in assaults on ICE
um employees 500% increase in assaults
so if you were working in a job where there was a 500% increase in assaults
and the Democrats were saying "Hey take off those masks so we can assault you
even better." That can't be popular is it is it isn't
that another 8020 where 80% of the country would say oh yeah if they need to protect themselves
they they have to do what they have to do or do you think
um yeah or do you think uh that people agree with that that ICE should take off
their masks so the gangs can figure out who they are
i don't know i think uh I think I would let them keep the masks in this
environment all right ladies and gentlemen that's all I got for you today um there will
not be a spaces after today's show that will be tomorrow Sunday so we'll I'll
tell you about that tomorrow and I'm going to say a few words privately to the local subscribers beloved beloved
local subscribers and uh hope you'll come back tomorrow same time same place
all right locals we're going to go private in 30 seconds
