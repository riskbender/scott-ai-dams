let's uh take a look at the stock market And the U S&P 500 is basically
flat Tesla is up 1.24 Rumble
up.34 Flat Let's call that flat All right we got a show to
do which is mostly me You're uh your responsibility is kind of
easy You're expected to do nothing
except
simultaneous Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human
civilization It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a
better time But if you'd like to take a chance on making this experience even
better all you need for that is a cup or a mug or a glass a tanker
gel or Stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind Fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the unparalleled pleasure the
dopamine the end of the day the thing that makes everything better It's called the simultaneous sip and it happens Now
go Yep Yeah that was it That made everything
better you to well I wonder if there's any science that would support the idea
that coffee makes you healthier Oh yeah According to uh CNN there's a new study
that says uh you can reach a older age if uh women especially who drank one to
three cups of caffeinated coffee per day in their 50s were more likely to reach
older age So got that you uh if you drink your
coffee ladies you'll live to an older age Now in a related uh well I I'll make
it related story Um according to science
mag repetitive negative thinking is linked to cognitive decline
So if you have bad thoughts and you just keep having bad thoughts your brain will
corrode So put it all together Every morning you should get up
before anybody's up have your cup of coffee and then think positive thoughts
and your brain will be healthy and you'll live forever Yep As for the ladies sip your
coffee have positive thoughts And did you know that uh having consistent
negative thoughts is uh also implicated in uh other major mental health diseases
such as uh what's the other stuff i think anxiety and depression
So if you ever said to yourself I think there's there's an
upside to having continuous negative thoughts Turns out there's no
upside You should do whatever it takes to have continuous positive thoughts Now
can you do that well I feel like you could You know even though there are
some people who have you know legitimate mental problems that would cause them to have repetitive negative thoughts
um doesn't it make sense that you could force yourself even for 10 seconds to
think something positive and if you could do it for 10 seconds do you think
you could do it for 20 seconds like if you just started
small I feel like most people if they really worked at it could uh at least
increase the percentage of the day they're having a positive thought Seems to
me Well uh some of you asked me to solve the the mating problem the demographic
collapse And so I thought to myself that seems
impossible So I I'm gonna take a swing at it
Okay So it starts with this story So Nate Silver in his latest blog post um
apparently he he was saying that uh conservatives are up 31 points among
those with self-described excellent mental health
Now we've talked about this before It turns out that uh the people who are on
the left um tend to have terrible mental health compared to the people on the
right Now I'm going to tell you why and you're going to say "Oh that
actually makes total sense." Here's why
And this is totally my own hypothesis but once you hear it you're
going to say to yourself "Huh that explains a lot It goes like
this You can only be happy when you're connected to the most important part of
life." What is the most important part of life well if you believe in science
and evolution and biology the most important part of life is making more
life Now you might say to yourself what about you know my search for meaning and
all that well that's great but the single most important thing that a h
well any animal can do is to make more of itself Now the good news is I don't think you
have to be literally the one having a baby or even married to the one who's
having a baby I think you could have step kids I think you could be helping
somebody who has kids you know maybe like a a grandparent who does a lot of babysitting that sort of thing But I
think if you're not if you're not directly connected to the essentially the energy
source for all of life which is the reproductive
thing I think it's going to be really hard to be happy
Now what if you could convince the people on the left that uh the reason
the people on the right have better mental health is because they're sort of naturally connected to
the political right kind of a thing And then you look at the political
left and doesn't it seem to you that they're a little less interested in
having kids So if you could connect the two
ideas and how many of you uh buy my hypothesis
hypothesis that uh the thing that makes you happy is being connected to the main
thing your biology is requiring of you which is to be part of the reproductive
flow of humanity Well try it out because you
probably have some depressed family member who doesn't know why they're depressed and they're on drugs Can you
imagine how they would feel if they were having a baby probably really stressed but also
that they would feel like they were attached to something with
meaning Anyway Disney is uh according to Breitbart uh Disney's laying off
hundreds of people and they're going to downsize their entertainment division I was watching a uh real the
other day on the internet and it was somebody who works in in the LA
Hollywood area and they seem pretty pretty bleak because apparently
they're just no projects like there nobody's making a movie and if they are
they're not doing it there So it looks like the whole movie making industry
is kind of dead I don't know if it's coming back It
uh seems to me that everybody's looking at AI and expecting somebody to make a
feature length movie you know in the next probably one
year And uh I always thought I would like to do that but um I'll have to feel
a little better to make that happen So maybe possibly Uh meanwhile
um Elon Musk's company Neuralink just raised
$650 million which would value the company at about 9 billion
And the the thing I wondered was does Elon Musk even care that his net worth
went up a few billion dollars i don't know what percentage he owns but can you imagine being so rich
that you wake up and one of your companies raises your net worth by I
don't I'll just take a guess4 million4 billion and he just made $4
billion and it it wouldn't change his day at all he his day would be exactly
the same with you know $4 billion if that's what it
was Well Sam Alman says "The world must prepare together for AI's massive
impact." And then he said something that is the funniest thing a marketer ever
said He said that open AI releases imperfect models early so the world can
see and adapt and help shape regulations He says there are going to
be scary times ahead Now do you believe that open AI intentionally is
releasing and has been defective models
uh because it helps people get ready for the real thing
Does that sound to you why they're releasing defective models it it's not
because that's all they have Now I don't think you would argue with the fact that they don't know how
to make them non-deective They I don't think they know how to make them stop hallucinating as far as I
know But uh it seems a little uh little little bit cheeky to say that releasing
them with flaws is really helping society because then the flaws don't
make them that dangerous but then we can we can imagine what they will be like without flaws and then we can get used
to it and and prepare for it alto together
Okay So uh I've got some advice coming up from from some people who have some
ideas how to survive this age of robots and AI but we'll get to
that Meanwhile Scientific America says that uh there's a Chinese company that
found out how to bring your dead car battery back to life if you have an electric car I'm talking about the the
uh lithium ion batteries in your electric car So currently if your
electric car has a bad battery or you you know you've it's run its course
um I don't know what they do to recycle it or whatever but it's sort of just
this big problem But this Chinese company used AI which
is a big part of the story They use AI to look at all the chemical reactions
that could revitalize a lithium ion uh yeah lithium ion battery And they
actually got three suggestions and one of them worked So all they did was uh
they took a dead battery Now dead is not dead dead Dead is like when it reaches
80% capacity I think if it goes down from 100 to 80% That's uh considered
unusable And uh they found they could squirt some of this uh chemicals in
there and it would revitalize it and suddenly it would be like exactly as
good as a new battery Now there's some problems You know there's safety testing and you'd have to redesign the batteries
So there's a way to inject something So that's sort of would be kind of a big deal And it might result in fewer sales
of new cars because if you could keep your battery running forever well why would
you need to upgrade because the software would be upgrading on its own So anyway so I don't know if that
has any place in the market but that's pretty impressive
I also didn't know that current batteries are supposed to last 15
years Does that sound right if you got a Tesla the uh battery that comes with it
would last 15 years That would be
impressive Maybe it does Well I usually don't talk about the uh
individual crimes and even if they're mass shootings and stuff but uh this
illegal alien Muslim terrorist guy from Egypt to quote Jim Ha the gateway pundit
So as most of you know if you watch the news um he uh he used what did he use
um Molotov cocktails and alcohol set them on fire and threw them at a group
of American Jews who were um who were together I don't know if
you'd say protesting or rallying and it was in I think they were
rallying in favor of the uh in support of the hostages or something But this
guy shows up He's not even a legal citizen and uh he firebombs a group of Jewish
people who were just trying to support essentially people who were
hostages That's my understanding of it And I was trying to think are Jews the
only group in America who are attacked when they're grouping
together because I remember the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue attack and I was
thinking to myself is there any other situation where a group of Americans u
that are in some demographic if they group together they're likely to be
victims in other words I've never heard of the Pride parade being attacked and I
hope it isn't I've never heard of I don't know a woman's group being
firebombed So you can certainly see how the uh the question of anti-semitism in
the United States is you know at the top of the list of uhoh uh we better do
something about this And one of the things you could do about it would be uh
not to let in uh Egyptian terrorists if that's what he is
That would help That would that would be a good start Have you noticed how there was a
period when uh Trump first became president where we couldn't stop talking about the price of gas and the price of
eggs well it turns out the price of eggs was doing great Uh so it's according to
Newsmax uh dozen eggs is under $3 in most places
and the average cost is down to
$2.52 Um so according to the White House rapid response team that means a the
price of eggs has dropped 61% since Trump took office Uh but the best thing about that
is it made Democrats just shut up about the one thing they understood
If you thought about it the the one thing the Democrats had on their side
was that Trump had overpromised stuff like he would do things on day one Well
day one doesn't really mean day one It just means you know as fast as
possible you know we'll get right on it And uh I would say you know if you're
only halfway into the first year it looks like you got right on it So your
your egg prices went down and gas prices are down and uh maybe gas prices will
get go down some more because uh Trump just opened with another executive order
23 million acres of Alaskan wilderness to drilling
So Doug Bergam is you know driving that And that reverses a Biden era drilling
ban I wonder if companies feel safe um going into business drilling up there
If the possibility of a Democrat getting elected could put them out of
business is that a thing or would even a Democrat say "All right if you've
already drilled you know that's allowed but no new
drilling." I don't know Is uh would the Democrats use common
sense hard to know But of course the
uh some people are worried about the habitats for grizzly bears and polar
bears and caribou and migratory birds and they don't want to lose the caribou
I mean what would you do without caribou if there's one thing I need when
I want to drive my car to a distant location more caribou I'll be like "Oh man I only made
it one one mile Why?" Well I only had access to one caribou
So ladies and gentlemen it's sort of a tie On one hand you get a bunch of oil
that you know drives civilization Boring On the other hand you lose some caribou
possibly All right Now one of the things I wonder when I read a story like that is how much oil
is up there because doesn't it sort of also matter how much because yeah I'm in
favor of opening it for drilling but in the back of my mind I'm
assuming that it has a tremendous amount amount of known
reserves because I would kill a few caribou for an
enormous reserve but suppose there's only a
little bit there Well that's sort of a I would only kill like one caribou for
that Meanwhile over in Poland there was a presidential election and a what's
being called by Reuters a proTrump nationalist has won the
presidency in Poland uh somebody named Carol
Noraki and he won narrowly but apparently he's got that um that Trump
vibe about him So do you think that's actually a
Trump or is that some kind of a coincidence are people really going to
just start copying Trump because it works maybe
I don't know if that makes the world a safer place or not Um how many Trumps
can you have in the world and the funny thing is the uh I think he knocked out somebody named
Donald Tusk That's pretty weird A weird
coincidence Anyway we'll see if that's the Trump effect if it affects any other
countries All right So there's a gentleman named Alex Karp who is the uh
the CEO of Palanteer So he's a he would be a multi-billionaire by now And he was
asked at some event about secrets for success it looks like And he said the
following He said "I've never met someone successful who had a great
social life at 20 If that's what you want that's great
but you're not going to be successful and don't blame anyone else." Um and
then he also says that you know picking the right partner in life is important Now do you buy that do you buy that uh
if you had a great social life in your 20s that your odds of being successful
are very low you know career-wise successful I I have to
admit that if people are not just totally hopping it in their 20s it would
be hard to imagine that they're going to start humping it in their 30s But if I look at my own career uh arc in
my 20s I was just working regular jobs and trying to get my MBA and uh basically I
was just building up my talent stack But by the time I reached my 30s that's when
I that's when I launched Dilbert and I found myself working full-time doing a
Dilbert comic strip writing a book working on licensing
projects It was insane The the amount of work I put in
was just through the roof So while I do believe that people in
their 20s if they're not working pretty hard at something you know that's a bad
sign But I think there are two things you can work at One is working directly
on that startup or whatever it is that's going to make you rich But the other is
uh building your talent stack Uh I think either one of those
gets you someplace So uh if you were to look at my life in my 20s it looks more
relaxed going to a corporate job you know taking all the classes that they offered uh taking a Dale Carnegie class
um learning about technology learning marketing learning strategy So I was learning all those
things and I was very aware that I was just building up my skills so that
someday I could do my own thing I didn't think it would necessarily be cartooning
but all of those skills including the technology stuff uh directly went into
Dilbert Then there's uh Mark Andre
uh who's talking about uh the world of uh robots in the future Now this is not
directly uh uh self-help advice but it's a little bit uh telling you the future
So Mark Andre famous investor if you don't know who he is uh says general
purpose robotics is going to happen at a giant scale in the next decade Now
that's what most of us think but when it comes from somebody like Andre then it
just seems more credible Um and he says the US should not try to get the old
manufacturing jobs back which would suggest you should not be
waiting to get your manufacturing job back He says instead we should uh lean
lean hard into designing and building robots Now I assume we're doing that I
don't know exactly what the government is doing to make it easier to build robots but um as Andre points out
otherwise we will live in a world of Chinese robots
Can you imagine how dangerous it would be if if you had a full-sized humanoid
robot that was built in China and its intelligence could be you know updated
and controlled just through the cloud through China And if China wanted to
overthrow the United States all it would have to do is activate all the robots at the same time grab a knife off of
kitchen counter stab inhabitants So yeah we'd better start
building our own robots like really fast Build those robots So if you translate
this into some kind of uh you know meaningful career path
advice there must be elements of robot building that you could identify as
current jobs for human beings I don't know
exactly what that would be because I don't know enough about the robot building world But I'd be looking hard
into what is it that you need to build and sell robots that the robots won't do
themselves if there is anything because that's going to be a pretty big
area Anyway according to the Gateway Pundit Christine Christina Leila so you
may have heard this story but this is this one's a really spicy one Um so the
FBI and Muller's team you remember Mueller uh apparently they hid Russy
gate documents using a special coding system that you can use to make things
invisible to people who are searching for them Now imagine uh so at this point I think
uh you know Bino and Cash Patel have
identified the code that was used to hide all the good stuff Now why do you
think the this is regarding the uh um the Russia gates
collusion i feel like this is going to be the thing that tells you what all the
people did all the bad people So right now we sort of have this general idea
that the FBI was presented with this idea you know that uh you know maybe
maybe Trump had some Russia connection but we all know that it was it was
organized via the uh Hillary Clinton campaign but it feel I feel like the
reason nobody's going to jail for it is there's not quite the paper trail you would need to prove who did what and
when and what they were thinking and what their intentions were and all that stuff And it could be that this
new discovery that there's a secret code where all the good stuff was hidden we
might find out just how bad this was The my only concern is that there
are so many things that happen in the news especially in the Trump world that
the energy has already been taken out of the topic And the uh the people on the left
and the the mainstream uh media will just say "Ah that was a long time
ago." And it would just act they'll just act like it's not a big deal And then the uh political right will be screaming
and saying "Are you kidding we just proved that you tried to overthrow the government of the United States or
influence an election which would be sort of the same thing." And and we have
the names and we've got the exact details and that's not going to be
anything So that's what I predict I predict there will be some really spicy things that
come out of this but that the mainstream news will talk about it once and then
it'll act like it doesn't matter So unless there's a uh you know
some kind of prosecution it will just sort of disappear
Well uh Steve Bannon on his uh War Room show had author of uh Putin's playbook
Rebecca Coffler and she says that we're already in a kinetic war with Russia
because Russia would know that that very clever drone attack that Ukraine
apparently pulled off to destroy a bunch of Russian bombers that there's no way
that they could have done that without direct US support at the very
least our satellite images but probably more than that And I thought to myself
oh I'm an idiot Not once did I think oh the United
States was obviously involved in that attack I didn't think that once And it's
kind of obvious once somebody who's an expert points it out you go
"Huh yeah actually there's a pretty good chance that America was involved in
that." But then related to that
um apparently Russia is deploying Chinese lasers that would be defensive tools for
knocking down any drones and maybe missiles too So there's a uh video
that's been posted on Telegram that shows a team of Russian uh military
people uh operating this Chinese drone
laser Now you see what's happening right
russia and Ukraine have become a weapons testing area for first the United
States and now for China and Russia and and Ukraine are
just sort of caught in the middle And I also thought to myself do
you know who's preventing Russia from attacking the United States besides
perhaps Russia themselves probably China Do you think China that buys 80%
of the energy that Russia sells do you think they have the power to say no
you're not going to war we might you know test some weapons and you know we
might uh keep crawling along the way things are going but she can't start World War
II I feel like China would have that power now So that we're not even really
dealing with Russia Exactly Um I think that China has probably pulled off a a total
control move because they're the biggest customer of Russia and they can bankrupt
them anytime they want So I think we're safer than you think
because China would not allow Russia to escalate beyond the point where they're
just testing some Chinese weapons So I think that so-called war in
Ukraine is just going to keep going as a stalemate
Um a uh another guest on the war room named Boon Cutler he asked the following
question which is a good idea Um what would happen if all those Chineseowned
properties I think most of them are farms that are near military bases in
the United States What if they also have swarms of
drones they're right next to military bases So they could attack the military base in you know a
minute So uh maybe we should look at that Now I haven't seen any evidence
that the land that's being bought that's near military bases is you know being
stocked up with weapons But I would definitely worry about it I I would look into it a little
bit So yeah let's uh find out a little bit more about
that Meanwhile according to uh interesting engineering
um in Russia the uh kids are going to be taught I guess it's a mandatory class
They're going to be taught how to operate drones So they'll all be little uh drone
experts To which I say isn't that worthless in one
year won't all the drones be self-driving why would you why would you
put a human in the drone operating
position you know even if the AI is operating the drone at the very least
the human will be uh relegated to final decisions So I think the the drone will take off
It will decide because AI is you know operating the entire war Uh the drone
will know where to go for maximum impact and the the weakest defense and it'll
pick its targets and maybe but not even necessarily it might show it to the
human and then the human says yes or no Yes attack that tank
But it doesn't seem to me that you're going to need a lot of human operators for drones in one year Is that too soon
i think in one year it if we have full self-driving Teslas that are giving you
know civilians rides in cities throughout the United States You think the drones are going to be operated by
humans i mean maybe in some specialty way but doesn't seem like a useful skill
in the future So Jeffrey Sachs
um who was on the All-In Summit way back in September of 2024 he had some
interesting things to say about Taiwan And I'm not going to say I agree
with it or disagree with it but he makes a he makes a good case
He says uh China first of all is not a threat to the United States security uh
big oceans big nuclear deterrent and so forth Second we don't have to be in
China's face Uh what do I mean by that he says we don't have to provoke World War II
over Taiwan That's a long complicated issue but this would be the stupidest thing
for my grandchildren to die for We have three agreements with China that
say we're going to stay out of that and we should And I have to say um the idea of
dying because of something about Taiwan that does seem like a really bad
reason for an American to die Now on the other hand Taiwan is an ally
and we must have made some assurances that you know we would be helpful But I
wonder to what extent just giving them weapons would be enough It seems to me that if you know
in the long run there's no possible way that Taiwan will remain independent
forever It was it's not like a thousand years from now if he came back Taiwan would be
independent One way or the other the the big uh the big country is
going to overwhelm the little country that's right next to him So it doesn't
seem to me that dying over something that's going to happen anyway whether
you love it or hate it it's going to happen anyway Um he makes a good
point So probably we'll have to pretend that we're doing something
useful while uh letting China have its way is my
guess How many of you uh show me in the comments have lost a connection to a
family member it could be your own child could be your parents because of
politics I just I just wonder how universal this is because I was reading a thread on
X of people who were talking about losing family members that hadn't talked
to them since the election How many of you were in that category oh my god I'm seeing a string
of yeses go by in the comments Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes
Yes Yeah Incredible That is so disturbingly
dangerous for this country Wow
Um so I was thinking to myself um how do you deprogram those people and
the answer is you probably can't because they've chosen to have no contact with you But if you could
uh I would start with the fine people hoax and I would I would also start I
would set it up this way I would say have you ever found out something that
just totally rocked your world because you thought it was one way but then you you found out you'd been fooled and it
was another way such as let's say the uh the nutrition pyramid the food
pyramid Now if you can get if you can get your family member to admit that
they had ever experienced believing something was completely true and then learning it
wasn't say can I show you another one just to blow your mind
It won't change your view on politics but I want you to I want you to see how easily you could be led to believe
something that isn't true And then you do the fine people But make sure you
found the American debunk website because it it'll show you the you know
the full the full video to prove what's going on But
then a lot of these people think that the real problem was the January 6
insurrection And I'm going to tell you the worst argument you can make if
you're trying to talk somebody out of believing it was an insurrection All
right you can't say it wasn't dangerous because people got hurt So you have to
acknowledge that you that you both agree that the violent part was uncalled for
and that those people had to you know they had to be dealt with Now they they didn't go to
jail Um even even if they were pardoned they they did serve some serious time
But here are the bad arguments Don't say the feds were behind it
because that's unproven As soon as you say "Oh the feds it was a Fed erection." No Feds erection
not a Fed erection As soon as you say it was the feds even if it
was even if it was it's not an argument that would work with a Democrat because
they would just reject it as ridiculous It's like well there weren't that many
Um so whether or not you're sure the feds were behind it it's a bad argument
so just drop it The second bad argument is you know for sure the election was
stolen You might be right that the election was stolen but since there's no
proof that any Democrat would ever accept it's a terrible argument
Now you just said to yourself uh how are we going to argue against January 6
being an insurrection if he just told us that all of our obvious arguments are
terrible arguments well you can use a good one Here's a good argument Now it
will take a few explainings for the person that you're working on to understand that you're in
completely solid territory It goes like this The only thing you need to know is
what the nonviolent protesters were thinking when they entered the capital
What were they trying to accomplish and then point out that nobody's ever done a TV show or
even a podcast in which the the protesters are brought in and they ask
the following question Why were you protesting what were you trying to
accomplish now I believe the answer would be in every case we it looked to
us like the election was stolen So we were trying to slow things
down to see if we could check it so that we can save the republic Now you may have just said to
yourself Scott you just said don't use the argument that the um election was
stolen Here's the tough part I didn't What I said was that the protesters
might believe that based on the fact that it broke pattern So it broke
pattern in terms of you know those last minute votes for Biden and the fact that
there were so many of them and it's it's off uh historical pattern It broke
pattern in the bellweather counties or precincts So it broke pattern Now that is not
proof that anything was stolen The only thing you need to know
is that the protesters believed it didn't look like a credible
election You don't have to argue whether it was actually stolen If you argue
whether it was actually stolen that's the end of the argument because a
Democrat will be like "All right go away Go away." There's no evidence it was stolen I'm not going to listen to the
rest of it But if you can get them to understand that it's not about what you
or they think it's about what the protesters thought So if the protesters
thought it was a perfectly fair election and they were trying to delay it or stop
it it was an insurrection That's what I'd call it
right if they believed that the election was fair and they and they did what they
did anyway trying to delay the certification well that's a little bit
insurrectiony you know not really effective because they didn't have any chance of succeeding
But if they believed right or wrong and this is
important right or wrong if they believed that the election did not look
credible then having a delay to make sure it was credible would be saving the
republic It would not be an insurrection at all So that might be a little too
complicated but uh that would be the only clean path to convincing somebody
who was willing to listen that uh that that was a hoax It
was no insurrection It was uh patriots trying to make sure that we got the
right result All right
Uh so uh the other day I wittyly pointed out that Democrats
only did two things wrong in the last several years The two things they did wrong were all of their candidates and
all their policies Now of course I was saying that for humorous intent but then
other people said but what about their messaging now I think that candidate and
policies covers messaging too But just to uh put a little light on that
um here's the comparison in messaging where uh Bernie and AOC were
saying things like we have to stop the oligarchs Trump was saying we're going
to enter the golden age Which one of those is better messaging stop the
oligarchs or come with us We're going to enter the golden
age Those are not close That that is the worst messaging
ever How about this one uh equity Yeah we we want to have
equity or we want common sense Which one's
stronger we got to fight for equity so everybody gets the same uh payout no
matter what they put in or we've got to fight for common
sense Again these are not close It's not like you're
like six one you know half a dozen of the other you as soon as you hear them
you go "Oh I like the golden age and I like common sense but stop the oligarchs
and give me equity." It just doesn't resonate But then you've got Tim
Walsh who's uh teaching teaching Democrats how to code talk like a real
man And lately he said that a good strategy
would be to bully the out of Trump
What bully the out of him That That's the messaging from the
Democrats Oh my god that's bad Anyway
um and then the last story that I have for [Music] you which I think is a very important
one is that China now has a uh a negotiator for the trade deals And uh
believe it or not President Xi hired somebody named
he I'm not making that up He E that's his first name So she hired
