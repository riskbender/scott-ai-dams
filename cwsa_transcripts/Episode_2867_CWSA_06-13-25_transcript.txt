there you are it's about time let's check on your stocks oh no
your stocks are not doing well well forget that we'll get back to that
all right let's call up your comments so we've got it all
there we go [Music]
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to Coffee with Scott Adams
and if you'd like to take your experience up to levels that no one could even understand with their tidy
shiny human brains all you need for that is a copper mug or a glass a tanker
jealous or ste a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure the dopamine the hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now go
oh yeah that was good i must say your sipping was excellent
today yep so I don't know if you've heard but uh Israel attacked Iran
has anybody heard that it's true well I'll uh talk about that first
because that's the big news overshadowing everything else
and the first thing I need to say before I talk about Israel versus Iran is that
I am an observer um my interest is in America
so it's not for me to approve of anything that Israel does or to condemn
it i will simply observe it and maybe rate it in terms of effectiveness
but uh I'm not making judgment calls you don't need my morality or my ethics or
my military opinions so the bombs are flying and I guess
Israel attacked the nuclear sites in Iran and the military sites and the
missile storage sites and uh also took out about six generals well no several
generals some say 20 people in leadership in the
military um and a bunch of uh nuclear
scientists um now how many of you knew that Israel
was going to attack yesterday now I didn't know it'd be yesterday but
when Trump announced he was uh drawing down the excess embassy staff
there wasn't another reason for doing that unless he knew an attack was coming
and you have to think he would know and he did so he had some advance uh
advanced warning now some people say that Trump was only negotiating because
it would keep Iran thinking "Oh you know the attack is not coming today because
they're still negotiating." But uh I I think when Trump drew down
the embassy staff and tried to make sure that there were fewer targets over there
that were American I have got a feeling that the Iranians
said to themselves "Uh-oh that would uh suggest that Trump you
know maybe is uh you know already been warned about something." And sure enough
the bombs uh came pretty soon now that was also after the uh I told
you yesterday the IAEA found a violation in what Iran was doing
with its nuclear program and uh Iran was being defiant about it as opposed to
trying to rectify that problem so that was another sort of indication
that something might be coming and then Israel has said as Trump has said that
uh they'd love to have a negotiated agreement but uh Iran can't have a nuke
and they were very close we don't know how close some people disagree but uh
they were definitely closer and um as uh
as Iran says quote "Death to Israel and death to America are not just slogans
their policy." Now what the hell was the Supreme Leader
of Iran actually thinking was he thinking
that Israel wasn't serious when they said you you know you can't
have a nuke did he think that if Israel
and the United States cuz he wouldn't know at that point um both tried to deny
Iran a nuclear program by bombing them
did he think that wouldn't work or did he think that if the US andor
Israel bombed Iran and bombed their nuclear sites do you think that that
would somehow work out well you have to wonder what what was he
thinking because I was over here thinking "Oh obviously Israel's going to
take action if we don't help them they'll do it themselves." Now doing
doing it themselves is sort of a relative statement
um yeah we've been saying for years that they're close to a nuke but they're probably closer
and it was it was sort of obvious that Israel was was going to attack because
they basically said so they they said if you can't find some other way to do it
you know I mean it was obvious that an attack was coming so I'm very curious
what the hell did I and and their supreme leader what were they thinking
you know in what way were they going to win this contest did they really think you know I don't
know God was going to step in or did they think uh
maybe they had bad intelligence but at the moment it looks like Iran's
military was no match um because Israel took out all of their
basically all of their uh defenses and so Israel owns the sky over Iran and
they've got plenty of skybased vehicles and it looks like Iran shooting back 100
drones which in today's day and age doesn't seem like much
so we'll really see if uh there's something coming you know maybe there's there's a
big surprise coming i don't know i don't know what it would be but uh one of the
things that always happens when there's a military action by Israel
there there's always a phase where were amazed at how clever it was
[Laughter] and it's just automatic it would be like no matter who Israel attacked the next
day we'd be talking about how clever it was it's like oh they made the pagers explode
oh they did this or that so this is no exception so apparently Israel claims to
have built a drone base to manufacture drones within Iran
so that when the uh just before the the bombing started they they used their
local drones to blow up a bunch of uh you know defensive Iran Iran's air
defenses do you believe that
you know remember that during a war the uh information that comes out about
the war is not really that believable
because both sides are going to be exaggerating and you know trying to get you to believe their side so I think you
can believe the big obvious stuff for example you could believe that
Israel really attacked Iran but when it gets to any of this any of this detailed
stuff such as Israel had their own drone base in Iran that was a secret base
maybe maybe and if it's true it would be impressive and you know quite clever but
remember it's just military reporting so we don't really know we only know the
big stuff small stuff might be a bunch of look how brilliant
we are kind of stuff and it does look like the attack was successful
now they uh allegedly Israel has killed uh Hussein
Salamen now you might call him Salami because you don't respect them um but he
was until yesterday the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard so that would be the head of the whole military
and uh according to CNN there's uh evidence that all of Iran's general
staff including the head of the military were eliminated so all of the Iran's
general staff means all the staff of the generals I guess
uh Reuters says uh two Iranian officials are saying that at least 20 senior
commanders were killed in Israeli strikes 20 senior commanders so it might
take them a little while to reorganize and decide how they're going to respond
um now Trump the way Trump was playing it
was to try to keep the United States out of it so that when Iran responds which
of course they will that they would respond only against Israel but it seems
uh that Israel is you know lumping
well Iran is lumping Israel and United States together as the the two devils
that must be defeated so my question is this
israel doesn't seem to have bunker buster bombs and if they had them they
couldn't use them because they don't have the kind of bombers that are required to carry them they have only
fighters so if Israel
if Israel wanted bunker busters the US would have to deliver them you know not
just deliver them to Israel but deliver them to the bomb site and drop them with
their own bombers and doesn't look like that's going to happen unless
Iran attacks the United States interests if uh if Iran decides okay we're not
going to buy this israel is doing it by itself it's always it's always with the
help of America if they decide to treat it as one thing and they go after Israel
but they also go after American assets um I don't think it would be long
before Trump would say "All right here come the bunker busters and they would
take out the nuclear fortresses that are they're extra deep." I'm not even sure
if the bunker busters can get the the main one there's one of them that's like 50 mi underground or something is it
just crazy i don't know how you get to that one but uh maybe if you collapse
the uh entrances that get you something i don't know
um makes me wonder if there's a cyber attack coming because Iran would
presumably have hackers and they would presumably be able to you know do a
cyber attack on Israel and the US but I haven't heard of one yet
and it makes me wonder does that mean that we're really good at defense
or does that mean that that Iran never had any hackers or does that mean that
they wouldn't use them against the United States because they they think the response would be too brutal
i don't know but it's kind of curious if we don't get a cyber attack isn't it and
would it be curious if nothing happens on our home uh on the homeland
i I think Israel I'm sorry i think Iran's biggest problem
is if they attack anything that the United States says it owns
um then the escalation will be very unpredictable now Trump might decide it's not worth it
but he might decide to go all in and given that uh Iran won't know in
advance which way that would go that would be the famous Trump unpredictability
definitely working in our favor right now um I feel like
Iran will probably hold off and not attack US interests
because that would just be the it would seem like the risks would be too high
and so Trump is playing this very interesting game where he's
pretending we have nothing to do with it well we were informed but we're not part
of the attack at the same time he's telling Iran uh that Israel is using US weapons and
they have no idea how much trouble they're in because those weapons are really good
so he's kind of having it both ways he he on one hand he's saying we're not
involved and on the other hand he's saying they're using our weapon so you're basically going to get wiped out
now given that uh Israel successfully took out the generals
do you think that the the non-military leadership you know the supreme leader
and his uh minions do you think that Israel has no way to get to them
i would assume that Israel could get to them as easily as they got to the generals
um so so one possibility is that uh Israel
is uh making sure to keep alive the current current leadership so they have
somebody to make peace with i guess that would make sense on the other hand it's
entirely possible that Israel has decided that uh they're going to go for
total victory total victory would be replacing
you replacing the leadership but the ideal way to do it would be if
the local population decided to stage an uprising because they didn't like the
war that their leaders got them into um however now that we've all been Mike
Ben's eyes and we understand how color revolutions
work and we understand you know when the CIA is involved and USAID used to be if
you heard that there was a internal local Iranian uprising against the
leadership would you believe that was organic
in 2025 are are we not well informed at this
point that whenever there seems to be some kind of grassroots organic protest
that's never real that's always fake so
I don't really see the local population rising up against the leadership
maybe that's a pipe dream and if it if it looked like it happened I'm not sure
I would believe it was organic so could be something inorganic is being
planned but no way to know uh Trump is actually
he said that he had given Iran 60 days to come up with an agreement and that
Israel attacked on day 61 so he's basically said "Yeah I told you." Now
one thing I like about that is that when Trump makes a uh threat
uh at least in most cases he's willing to go through with the threat
so if you were the Iranians and you knew they gave you a 60-day
deadline well now now you know what happens on day 61 it's not so good so you know that
might be uh something that works in our favor in the future but uh Trump is
actually inviting Iran back to negotiations uh even while the bombs are flying
so he really is trying to have it both ways which is that you know he's the
badass you better not uh cross me and go more than 60 days at the same time he's
the one saying "No no we don't need any war just come negotiate
come on come on come on over here and negotiate we'll take care of this." But
since uh since we know that Iran will not give up
their nuclear program even at the uh cost of losing everything
why i don't know it it just seems they're not being rational or they maybe
they've underestimated the will and military might of Israel at least it's
it's a little bit puzzling why they would act the way they are
because it doesn't look like they have a good hand and they would have to know that
you know could they look at the current situation and say "Well it looks like we
have some strategic advantage over Israel." Not really they're probably
weaker than they've ever been so it's hard to explain unless it's just you
know messianic religious irrationality or something whatever it is
anyway um
so Federman Senator Federman is uh all in
on this attack why is Federman so wildly pro- Israel i
mean it's not unusual that someone in the Senate would be pro- Israel but he's
he's sort of almost humorously laughably pro- Israel
what is up with that we don't know so Israel says that the remission will take
two weeks to complete does anybody believe that will take two weeks
no they they couldn't possibly get what they want in two weeks
how in the world like why why would you even think that's possible in two weeks
um I would say maybe a month or two
but they're not going to you know hostilities are not going to stop in two weeks how are they going to get all of
their uh all of their you know nuclear assets in two weeks
i don't know there there are probably thousands of targets if you count the
military plus the nuclear plus whatever else they need to bomb i don't know two
weeks seems a little fast but it does make sense to say two weeks because then
you give people you're giving people a sense of you know a target certainly if
they could get it done in two weeks they would be happy with that but what does
it mean to be done in this case do you do you think that
we'd be not we but do you think Israel would be satisfied
with just destroying the current assets of the regime and then pulling back and
letting them reconstitute i don't know if you look at Gaza
um it looks like the Israeli leadership has more of a let's let's settle this
once and for all attitude you know I told you early on that Gaza
was not going to go back to the old way whatever it was going to be it was going
to be under Israel's control and there wouldn't be any going back to Hamas
so with Iran is Israel just going to give it a black
eye and destroy its toys and then let it reconstitute
that does that sound like what the leadership of the current leadership of Israel would do
it doesn't to me to me it feels like they're going all the way
and all the way would mean a leadership change now how they do that
might be kind of subtle you in other words I I don't expect them just to blow
up a building where the where the grand leader is because then it just gets
replaced with the next radical guy so I don't know how they do that
but uh my guess is that they're not going to stop attacking
until they have a new a new government in Iran that's friendlier so we'll see
how long that takes um Netanyahu has uh made a video in which he compared
Iran's threat to that of Nazi Germany and he says that never again is now
you know one of the advantages and it's weird to say this but it is an
advantage if you have the uh the narrative of the Holocaust behind you in other words it's
part of your national story then when something new happens
um people will pretty much automatically you know go to that model because we all
know what the Holocaust is so as soon as you see somebody attacking Israel and
saying Israel must be you know wiped off the map and you know death to Israel
you you don't have to wonder like you you don't spend a lot of time thinking
well how bad is this you know scale of 1 to 10 you go immediately to the
Holocaust now in this case is that appropriate
is this um is this the size of a risk of
the Holocaust and I would say it looks like it because
they're building up the weapons that could destroy an entire country iran is
and they're saying out loud and they've said for years and they say it clearly
we want to basically wipe out your whole country now sometimes they try to put
some nuance on that and make it sound like no no it's it's not about killing
the people oh no we would never do that it's more about you know the the
government so we'd want them to have a you know a more compatible government
well nobody believes that so I don't know what's true but nobody would
believe that so this is one of those cases where the
uh the Holocaust narrative works in favor of Israel because it gives them more options
if uh if you put us let's say the United States in this situation
where your enemy was developing nuclear weapons and telling you that their plan
is to kill all of you would you act in a military way before
that was possible to stop them well yeah wouldn't you it's hard to imagine it
would be any country that would not do some version of what Israel is doing right now which is saying "All right we
can't we can't live in the same neighborhood as you when you're developing nukes and telling us you're
going to kill us all even if you're lying about the killing us all part."
So there was only way one way this was going to go right
how many of you thought there was some other way this would go to me it seemed
obvious that the that Israel was going to have to attack now remember I started
off by telling you I'm not uh I'm not the one who approves of what other
countries do or disapprove i'm observing and my observation is there was only one
way this was going to go it was a matter of when
but it wasn't really a matter of what way is it going to go and I thought
Trump had signaled clearly enough that he was going to make sure America
had a little bit of distance but at the same time
making sure Israel had all the assets that needed to get the job done so
anyway so most of the uh military assets that uh Israel is using appear to be um
their air force and and missiles so the good news is for Israel
that whatever fatigue their their military has from Gaza and I would
imagine it's quite a bit um that's not exactly the same military force that
they're going to use against Iran because uh Gaza is mostly at least at
this point a ground war and Iran is almost entirely an air war
so you know they they probably do have enough assets to do both at the moment
because Gaza is reasonably under control from a military perspective oil prices
have surged 11% that should be temporary
um and uh here's another one of those uh
Israel or a bunch of military geniuses and things this might be true and it
might not be but it's it's very predictable so I saw this on the X account by Cre
i'm saying that wrong but I imagine I had good French anyway uh the post was
that former Iranian President Mahmud Amanad uh had said that quote "We created a
unit to counter Israel and the person who headed it turned out to be a MSAD
agent." No that that perfectly fits into the uh
the narrative that when Israel does military stuff it's super clever and
super effective so is it true that the head of the anti-Israel
uh unit in Iran was was a a MSAD agent
it might have been i mean I wouldn't rule it out but it fits perfectly into
that narrative of look at all the genius stuff Israel's doing militarily
so every time they they fire a rocket there's always a narrative of some
genius thing they did some of them will be true um
Mike Cernovich has an interesting non-standard prediction
he said uh on X "My unpopular take is that neocons have claimed Iran was much
stronger than it was to scam more military spending and that Iran isn't
going to retaliate in any material way in any material way." Now they've
already sent 100 drones toward Israel but is that a material way
you could argue that it was more you know more just reflex
you know just peruncter had to do something 100 was a big round number
so you could argue that that's not yet a material way because Israel probably shot down most of them
um but I I'm not on that page
but only because I don't know one way or the other it's a interesting kind of an interesting prediction
because we might see for the next few days not much of a reaction beyond
beyond you know some drones heading toward Israel but is it possible that
Iran would say you know we'd better not really do anything material now material
would be a major attack on the homeland of the US not necessarily by rocket but
if they had assets that are already embedded here they could do all kinds of terrorism i'm sure they're trained to do
that so I will uh I will join with Cernovich this far
which is you could imagine um a range of things that Iran could do
that would be bad for the United States i feel like they're not going to do the whole range
in other words I don't think there would be much of a cyber attack even if
they're capable of doing one there might be a little one or you know maybe one we
don't know where it's coming from and I don't think they're going to unleash
the domestic terrorists to you know bring down buildings in the
United States even though they obviously could you know they would have the wherewithal and they they've had years
to set things up so I think I'm going to
agree with Cernovich um that there will be a response
um and there has been already but it might be way less than you expected or
way less than are capable of doing um I think Cernovich is in the
capability camp that they don't have as much capability as you thought i'm in
the even if they have the capability they might hold back because there's
nothing good that could happen if they attack the homeland US it would be all bad although they've
been a little irrational so you never know well in theory
uh Trump will have a military parade tomorrow is that still on
it's kind of weird that a war would break out that we may or may not be
involved with and that we would have a huge amount of military assets placed in
one one easy to destroy place now obviously if somebody attacked
Washington DC you know they would have to make sure
that they destroyed the whole United States because if you attack Washington
DC you know we're not going to be happy until we've destroyed whoever did that
you know completely so on one hand it should be one of the
safest places you can be but doesn't it seem weird that we would have
you know a big parade full of military assets at the same time that there's a military action going on that were sort
of but not really part of it's kind of awkward
now it does give the Democrats an easy target so they can say "Look at him
trying to be an authoritarian with his uh with his despot looking uh
military parade." And I have to admit
part of me agrees with the Democrats that if you're just going to look at the look of it it does look like
you know he planned a birthday party for himself because I guess it's his birthday too um tomorrow and uh none of
that's true i mean the uh the history of this idea is that uh other countries
celebrated you know their victory in World War II but Trump wanted to make
sure that uh the world knew i don't think this is technically true but you
wanted to make sure the world knew that the US uh involvement in World War II is
what won it um I think it was more the Russians than the US if if I know
anything about history which I don't but uh certainly the US helped a lot and
maybe made it faster but the Russians would have crushed Germany eventually
uh I think so so so Trump was thinking you know let's
uh put down our put down our marker for what we did in World War II and you know
it's a way to respect the soldiers and it's flag day and those are good reasons
but none of them matter what what will matter is the visuals
so if the Democrats get a picture of Trump looking like a dictator with tanks
rolling by then they win because they would get the best image
if if Trump pulls off a dignified
uh respectful you know military parade where it just looks like we're strong and patriotic
well then he's at least going to break even i don't know if he can come ahead
on this one but uh we'll see and it's sort of interesting that it's not killed
um but I also doubt that we bring to a
parade the assets that matter the most than an actual fight it seems like we
would you know we would take all the halfbroken stuff you know the stuff that looks good and
we wouldn't take that many missiles or that many tanks so anyway um
in other news uh I feel sorry for the uh what I call
the LA photo op contest which you call the protest and or the riots over
immigration but um they are so overshadowed by the is Israel's attack
in Iran that it went from the thing we would talk about all summer to totally
unimportant in in just a few hours because how much
interest do you have in a few people burning cars and then you know and
they've even slowed down on that versus you know an entire war going on that
were kind of getting dragged into a little bit these are not equal so most of the juice
or energy for the whole protest uh against the immigration just got
sucked out of the whole situation but I saw a uh a take by Chris Cuomo News
Nation that I had not seen before and it changes everything
so obviously most of you know the uh the demonstrations or the the riots are
organized they're not organic in any way you know we we knew in advance it would
be summer protests and we know it's being funded by
somebody and organized by somebody and if it were not it wouldn't be happening
um but Chris Cuomo's take is that that that somebody who's funding it is China
and that China is using the immigration issue as a way to destroy the United
States from within and the evidence for that is that
there's a specific Chinese billionaire who we know to be funding it and he
would not be doing it except with uh the government of China saying yes
so if you look at these uh these protests it's not about the Mexicans and it's not
about the immigrants it's not about the illegals it's literally a war in which
uh China is destroying us with these protests and with you know whatever
other support they have for unlimited immigration because they know it will destroy the United States
and um I know that Trump said he was going to be looking into the funding
but what if he finds at the same time he's got these great trade deals with
China what if he finds that China is behind the protests
because according to Chris Cuomo I mean he works in the news business he's not
guessing um according to him we would find that China's actively attacking the
United States not only with fentinel which apparently was ignored in the
trade deal conversations but also uh with these protests
so how do you have a normal trade deal with somebody who's
uh very actively trying to destroy your entire country in a very visible way
it's it's weird that we pretend we're just trade partners when we're clearly
at war and when I say at war I mean they're at war with us i don't know if
we're at war with them i mean maybe our dark arts people are doing some bad
stuff to China we don't know about which seems likely actually but it feels
like it's just one way at this point so that's bad anyway the uh as I call it
the LA photo op contest um the Democrats are pulling ahead because the they had
this issue with Senator Alex Padilla
now it turns out that he's a senator from my state who I never heard of and
would not recognize if I saw him so he's a junior senator I guess and um
he made the mistake of attending a Christine Gnome event
and uh getting a little loud and looking aggressive while also not looking like a
senator so the security did a really good job of dragging him away because he
looked like he was you know just a normal protester and he looked like he might be a little bit dangerous because
he was big and he was you know not uh not taking directions to leave so that
looked a little bit dangerous so they uh very efficiently and professionally
pushed him into the hallway um took him down and uh handcuffed him
so that put the Democrats temporarily ahead in the photo op contest because they got
the great photo op now I have to say that my favorite part
was there there was one uh security guy i don't know who he worked for but he
was about half the size of Padilla who looks like a big guy and the the small
guy was just manhandling Padilla and you know manhandling him into the hallway it
was kind of impressive you know he he was obviously good at his job
anyway so uh security did a good job there in my opinion but Democrats got
the video and they got the photograph and then they got to be into full dramat
mode you know the dramcrats oh if they could do that to a senator oh
what could they do to a poor shopkeeper oh what will they do to you if they
could do that to a senator [Music] i'm crying so the dramcrats
just need a good photograph and a good story and they got both so they are
temporarily ahead in the photo op contest
um speaking of who's funding it Trump said
recently I believe they're paid and we're going to find out through Pam Bondi and her great staff um and I guess
my question would be this is there anything illegal about paying and
organizing a protest in the United States and what would it be what what would be
the law that's being broken i want it to stop and I want us to know
where it's coming from but I don't know if it's illegal
so that's an open question separate from the LA protest um but maybe they have
some connection i don't know is the no kings protest which is allegedly
triggered by the military parade so it'll happen tomorrow at the same time
and the idea is that while all the imagery is showing these tanks and
making Trump look like a dictator that they will say you know no kings um so
it's a protest to challenge Trump's perceived use of the army as a show of
force and symbol of authoritarianism now does that seem a little too
conceptual to you let me tell you what the No Kings
movement will accomplish so apparently it's nationwide
so there will be a whole bunch of events and they will all be marching with signs to say no kings no kings and it'll be a
picture of Trump now what if I taught you about how the
brain processes information if I told you no kings
does that make you think of no kings
no it makes you think of a king if I tell you Trump is no king does that make
you think "Oh I I guess that removes my thoughts about Trump being a king." No
it makes you think about Trump being a king so the weird part about this is that uh prior to the no kings march to I
guess it's tomorrow uh there was really zero chance that Trump could ever become
the king of America but now it's possible
it's made possible because if the news reports endlessly about an event called
No Kings and then you see pictures of Trump you will associate in your mind
Trump and King over and over again until half of the country thinks it's a good
idea so this is the dumbest
uh the dumbest uh event in all of events because they're taking something that
had 0% chance of happening Trump becoming a king and they're raising it
to 5% it's still very unlikely very unlikely
but they're taking something impossible and they're elevating it into well you
know if you had to have a king who would you choose
i mean think about it we don't want a king but if you had to
have one how many people would choose Trump about
half of the country so it's kind of hilarious to me that they don't understand what they're doing
so yeah no king meanwhile Gavin Newsome who is basically
Triumph the insult dog now yeah do you remember uh there used to be a puppet on
was it Conan Conan O'Brien show that was Triumph the insult dog
and the dog would just insult people that's what Gavin Newsome is now he
doesn't have any policies he doesn't have any ideas but uh he wants to talk
about uh Trump every single day and he wants to be Triumph the Insult Dog with
a bad haircut or a good haircut I guess um so here's what he said gavin Newsome
what an embarrassment honestly uh that's about as small as it gets how weak he's
talking about Trump here uh how weak do you have to be to comeander the military
to fet you on your birthday in a vulgar display of weakness that's Donald Trump
and Gavin goes on now remember this is classic Democrat they don't have a
policy they don't have a good candidate they don't have any good ideas all they
have are personal character insults so he goes on this is what he does he
creates a problem and then he tries to be a hero in his own Marvel movie
creates the problem and then tries to do a makeelieve as if you're all perfect little sheep and you're going to go
along with it and he'll be the hero in his own Marvel movie how how pleased
with himself was he to come up with that idea of the Marvel movie i I feel like
he was you know internally really satisfied with himself it's like oh the
Marvel movie yeah I'll just say he's making his own Marvel movie nobody said
that yet right that'll be clever yeah so then he makes us think about Trump being
a superhero in a Marvel movie good job Gavin
no if you keep telling us that Trump is making his own Marvel movie
we're going to think of him as one of the heroes again complete you know blindness to to
the persuasion uh level here and then uh the other thing that Gavin
has a weird hand moving so I should have read this with the the right hand
movements let's see if I can do that this is what he does he creates a
problem and then he has to be a hero in his own movie it's like a Marvel movie anyway
that's enough of that that was me moving my arms in case you're listening on audio all right um
as you know Trump had uh taken control of the California National Guard and was
having them guard some national or some federal buildings in the uh LA area but
um I guess a federal judge ruled that uh Trump had illegally federalized them
so a a court wants to return uh control back to Newsome
but there's an appeal so that's not going to happen until
Tuesday and it might not happen on Tuesday because the appeal is happening
so somebody's going to be in charge of the
National Guard but it doesn't sound like much of a king does it let's see a king
would be in control of the military and all branches of it but Trump
uh he didn't do the right paperwork because it's really just a process problem it's not even a question of
whether whether the president could have control of the uh National Guard it's a
question of whether he did it through the proper channels which would require the state to agree I guess
which doesn't make sense to me but maybe I have that wrong anyway
in other news um Bernie Sanders and Angus King of
Maine they're both independents they're proposing a ban on big pharma ads on TV
zero hedges talking about this now what would happen if they succeed
if they succeed then the biggest revenue source for the
news you know news network business would be removed
so the federal court of appeals stayed the order three hours later okay thank
you um so what would happen how how would we
know what's happening in in Israel if you didn't have the
networks that have pharma commercials something would have to happen to either
deny us news at least the expensive kind of news where you have to go on location
and stuff or there'd be an entirely new news model that has to be invented i
don't know which it would be but Um I also don't know what the odds of this
passing are i think it's probably low because the pharma probably has a lot of lobbyists so probably it won't go
anywhere well Trump has softened on his
uh opinion of deporting farm workers and people in the leisure
business like hotels because uh he realized that if you get rid of the uh
the uh non-citizens who were doing farm work and hotel work that those
industries would collapse now there is a legitimate
difference of opinion about how hard you should go at the the immigrants who are
doing work let's say work at a farm um I think Trump used the example of some
people who had been working at the same farm for 25 years now are we better off if we if we deport
the people who are doing those jobs well you probably say to yourself it depends
if we can fill those jobs with uh American citizens then we're better off deporting
everybody even if it's cruel uh the country would be better off i
would argue that your opinion of whether an American-born
citizen can fill those jobs is entirely based on your personal experience in
those domains now I have experience in the the leisure
business domain um specifically restaurants locally and
I could tell you that if you tried to fill those jobs with American citizens
you wouldn't come close now why i don't know i don't know but
the these are not jobs that you could just say "Hey I now have opened up a
whole bunch of farm jobs come work for me." Now maybe because they don't want
to work that hard for that amount of money maybe because the location they
they don't know how to relocate is expensive maybe i I don't know what the
reason would be but I guarantee you that those industries would have one hell of
a time staffing if they had to use American citizens what's wrong with
American citizens i I just don't know but it's true that if you live where
there are tons of uh tons of immigrants you can get any service done fairly
quickly and if you live where there's you know no impact of immigration at all and you
try to get somebody to fix your gutter that's falling off good luck good luck
on that it's just really really tough to find Americans to do a certain level of
of business they they just won't do it they'd rather be unemployed
so um there's room for there's room for disagreement as to whether that group of
people should be deported um I'll tell you from my real world experience
it's not going to buy you anything you You're not going to come out ahead so
whatever you want to do with that you can do with that
so uh apparently there's a website now that starts to describe the uh Trump
Gold card that's where if you have $5 million and you're willing to invest a
certain amount in the US you get to be a citizen so if you invest at least a million or at least uh blah blah blah or
you hire you have to hire at least 10 full-time positions and invest at least a million or some other some other
number all right so that's kind of fun we'll see if that works it's worth a try right that the
whole thing of selling citizenship to people who can you know increase
employment and make us a smarter country it's worth a try you know maybe maybe
it'll work i guess according to Newsmax the House
has passed a Doge cuts bill so if I understand this there's now a a separate
bill from the one we've been talking about that is just about cut
and I guess it barely passed the House which means I guess it has to do the
Senate next so this might explain why Musk and uh Trump
you know decided that they don't need to be enemies is it could be that Musk was
told that there would be a series of separate bills to do Doge cuts and this
would be the first one so we'll see if it gets all the way through
the New York Post is reporting that uh Gen Z is getting rid of their
smartphones and uh many of them are using Blackberries
because the Blackberry gives them the the basic communication without all the
other you know mentally destroying aspects so do you think that's real i'm
going to say that might be a thing um but I don't think it's going to catch
on because dopamine kind of beats everything i I definitely respect the
people who say I'm going to try to get off the dopamine trail you know or dopamine train I guess and you know I'm
going to have a Blackberry and that'll be bad enough but at least there won't be all those other raps that destroy my
brain i I get that but the dopamine uh
the dopamine pull of a smartphone I think is way too strong so I don't see
the Blackberry thing becoming like a a trend that eats the smartphones i see it
as something that a small group of hipsters who didn't get that much dopamine anyway from the raps u might be
willing to do for a short time but I don't see that being a big thing we'll see
um according to Zero Edge a company called Micron is going to invest 200 billion in America to reinforce our
global chip dominance so that would be another big win for Trump and his desire
to get uh chips and cars and other high-tech things made in America this
one's a big one $200 billion you over obviously over a number of years
um Stanford research finds that uh a therapist chatbot will just make things
worse if you have schizophrenia delusions or suicidal thoughts this is written up in futurism
um does that surprise you so a human therapist
you might break even but a chatbot therapist uh might make it worse you might even
end your life that's bad but it makes me wonder if this study was done by
therapists who didn't want to lose their jobs oh yeah no the uh the chatbot
therapists will kill you yeah you better pay me $400 an hour so I don't trust
that study i guess the CIA has released some more
RFK assassination documents but I haven't heard any news about that so those must be boring uh
Newsmax Health says that the CDC is going to um rehire 460 people who
have been laid off now that's out of 2400 people would have been laid off the
I guess 460 of them they decided they needed because they were working on stuff like you know deadly diseases and
minimizing them so the uh cuts went a little bit too
deep but some percentage of them will be reversed
i I don't know if that's a good job or bad job i can't tell goldman Sachs says that the odds of the
US going into a a recession are down to 30%
they used to have it at 35 30% what do you think 30% chance we'll go
into a recession i don't know there there's nothing right now that looks
like recession but uh anything's possible
according to Fox Business uh Trump might be looking at Scott Bent to replace
Jerome Powell in the Fed when uh when Jerome Powell's contract is up in a year
um I don't know how real that is but Scott Bent always makes me feel
confident when I hear his uh financial opinion so that might be a good choice
so Trump has ended the California electric car mandate which affected 17
other states um he called and he's also going to unveil a plan to ban windmills
which he calls one of the greatest scams and he calls it junkyard optics that's
really good junkyard optics you know before he said junkyard optics
um I used to think that seeing windmills was kind of cool and I would enjoy seeing them cuz they're big and they're
impressive and you know they're they're windmills if you haven't seen one
they're um almost scary they're so big because your brain doesn't really
process it it shouldn't be so big so to me looking at windmills was always kind
of fun but the moment that uh I read that Trump called it junkyard optics
it looks like a garbage dump to me yeah the the minute he said it or the
minute I read about him saying it I was like "Oh yeah yeah I can see that looks
a little junkyardy i see what you're saying." Meanwhile fentinel deaths are way down nobody
knows exactly why but they're almost cut in half some of it is because of the
Narcan that can save you if you're dying from an overdose some of it is young
people seem to be less interested in that kind of drug some of it is that the
fentinyl might be weaker some are saying so there might be several reasons why
but the good news is fentinyl deaths are way down uh compared to the past anyway
so that's all I've got for today thanks for joining everybody
hope you're uh entertained and smarter now and I'm going to say hi to the people on
locals who are subscribers the rest of you thanks for joining i will see you
