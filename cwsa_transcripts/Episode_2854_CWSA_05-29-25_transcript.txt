Some good news. If you're in stocks,
stocks are
up and that means we should do a
show. I probably would have done a show
anyway, but you
know. All right, get my comments working
here. They're working like crazy right
there.
Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of human civilization.
It's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time. But if
you'd like to take a chance on taking it
up to the next level, all you need for
that is a cup, mug, or a glass, a tank
or shell or ste a canteen jug or flask,
a vessel of any kind. Fill it with your
favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join
me now for the unparalleled pleasure,
the dopamine of the day, the thing that
makes everything better. It's called the
simultaneous sip and it happens now. Go.
Oh, I shudder with the goodness of it
all. All right. Well, as you know, Elon
Musk has he's uh out of the
government, at least in terms of Doge.
He's going to be full-time back at his
businesses. It's official now. I don't
think he quit. I think that was just the
normal time he was planning to leave.
But this is exciting. Uh, apparently
next month if you order a Tesla, and I
don't know if it's every model or just
the Model Y,
um, it will drive to your
house. So, you won't have to go pick up
your car. Your car will just with no
driver will just drive to your house and
then you have your car. That's about the
coolest thing I've ever seen in a
product. Tesla stock is up. Um, and it
looks like uh next month Austin will
have uh the driverless Teslas driving
around. So, that's going to be a big
deal. All right. Here's a
story that you are free to
disbelieve. It's a little bit too good
to believe. a little bit too good. So
there's a startup according to
interesting engineering that makes a
refrigeratorsiz machine that can make
gasoline out of thin
air. Now it's not out of just air. It uh
apparently allegedly it takes CO2 out of
the air and turns it directly into gas
you can use in your car with no with no
uh you know modifications required and
it uh can operate on renewable
electricity. So if you had a solar panel
and one of these refrigeratorsiz
machines you can make yourself some
gasoline right out of the air. How many
of you believe that that works?
And if it does work, may I add to your
concern? Because you're going to say,
"Oh,
no. It's going to ruin all vegetation on
Earth."
Oh, okay. I have to admit my back is
absolutely killing me today. So, I'm
going to be in
a in a
non-standard podcasting position. Oh,
that's so much better.
So, you might not be able to see me or
hear
me, but I'll be
here. Oh my god, that's much better. I
think I slept on it wrong. Well, RFK Jr.
is
uh threatening to ban scientists,
government scientists, from publishing
in top journals. Do you know why he
doesn't want scientists, at least
government scientists, to publish in the
Lancet and some of these other top
journals like the New England Journal of
Medicine and uh
JAMAMA? It's because they're corrupt.
So he says, quote, "We're probably going
to stop publishing in the Lancet, New
New England Journal of Medicine, JAMAMA,
and those other journals because they're
all
corrupt. Uh meaning that uh they've got
too much big pharma
influence." Now, can you even can you
even hold that in your
head that the RFK Jr. He's the US health
secretary and he's just said that the
major scientific journals in his field
are so corrupt that he's not even going
to let people submit papers to
them. Holy
cow. I I don't think there's another
person in the
world who would have said this or done
this, but I think he's right. I think
he's right.
Meanwhile, according to Fox News, uh the
president of
Harvard, he was giving an address and he
admitted that they're not doing enough
to have conservatives on campus and they
don't have enough, you know, voices that
are diverse.
And he said that the some faculty
members said to think twice before
teaching controversial
subjects. And uh he says the lack of
conservatives on the Ivy League campuses
um is uh because something about
expressing unpopular views and and now
he thinks they need more conservative
voices.
Now, is that what you think? Here's the
problem. Uh, his name is Garber, Alan
Garber. So, he said, "The administration
and others have said conservatives are
too few on campus and their views are
not welcome. In so far as that's true,
he he's acting like maybe it's not
true." In so far as that's true, that's
a problem that we really need to
address. Now, how are you going to
address it?
If you're the kind of entity that has
decided that conservatives are basically
Hiller, how do you go from, oh,
Republicans are Hitler to, you know, we
need more
Hillers? You know, it would be great if
we had like 30% hillers. That'd be just
the right
amount. I don't know. I feel like
they've painted themselves in a corner
and it wouldn't matter how much they
want to have more conservatives. the
conservatives aren't going to get near
it and uh the the other faculty would
think they were hiring killers and they
would all quit. So they might not have a
path. Uh meanwhile in San Francisco
um the uh school system came up with a
what they called an equity grading
system.
New York Post is reporting on this and
the San Francisco uh officials got rid
of it in one
day. So the idea was to make it easier
for people who weren't doing well in
school to also get good grades. And what
they were going to do is they were going
to um not grade them on homework even if
they skipped it. uh not grade them on
attendance if they cut class and they
could retake their final exam, which is
the only thing that would count toward
their grade. Well, it took uh 24 hours
for the collective powers to say,
"Nope. Nope. Let's get rid of that." So,
that's gone. I don't think that would
have been gone in 24 hours before Trump.
So, we're gonna call that the Trump
effect.
Um, all right. Speaking of the Trump
effect, the post millennial says that uh
GM has decided to invest $888
million into a big factory near Buffalo,
New York. So, more than they were
planning to do. Is that the Trump
effect? Or do you think maybe that would
have been somewhere else? I don't know.
I'm going to call it the Trump
effect. Here's something that sounds
like a little nerdy
story, but probably is immensely
important. So
MIT has announced this initiative for
new manufacturing according to MIT News.
So, it's an institute-wide effort aiming
to bolster industry and create jobs by
driving innovation across vital
manufacturing sectors. If you take the
jargon out of it, what it really means
is that MIT is going to be like Doge for
manufacturing.
Not so much in cutting costs, although
they might do that too, but rather
looking at it from the bottom up and
saying, "All right, instead of just
rebuilding the old kind of manufacturing
that we always did, because that's the
only thing we know how to do, the
geniuses at MIT
uh are gonna help, I guess, help
industry design manufacturing." That
makes sense. Now, I assume it's stuff
like, you know, using AI and, you know,
probably whole new systems that have
never been used before and 3D printing
and robots and whatever else. But the
only way the US is going to become a
manufacturing power again with a good
kind of manufacturing, you know, not the
not the low-end kind is this.
So, you know, Doge really can't be
underestimated because although this is
not Doge and has nothing to do with
Doge, it just feels like it wouldn't
happen unless Doge had sort of set the
standard that if you unleash your
geniuses in this domain, it doesn't take
long for them to fix everything.
So this is a small story that I think
could be one of the biggest stories in
the country if they things go right. So
MIT is not like other places the MIT
students the they're all like you know
big balls basically.
Well, according to futurism,
uh some economists did a study to find
out how much uh how much AI is saving
companies because companies are adopting
AI like crazy. They they just can't get
enough of it. Um so apparently white
collar workers are, you know, just
they're just racing to get more AI and
it looks like they saved
uh basically nothing.
They analyzed 25,000
workers and uh the only productivity
gains were 3 to 7% productivity
gains and
uh and none of them translated into
bigger paychecks or anything. So it
looks like uh AI has met Dilbert.
you know, Dilbert is sort of the standin
for, you know, the bureaucracy and doing
everything wrong. Um, apparently you
can't just take a bunch of people who
were a certain way and just layer A on
AI on top of
them. You you can't take Dilbert. Well,
you can take Gilbert, but you can't take
Wall-E and then add AI to Wall-E and
then suddenly he's a productive
employee, he's still Wall-E. Still
Wall-E. So, although although I do think
AI will eventually take
jobs, it's going to be a fight. The the
walls and the pointy-haired bosses are
going to have to duke it out for about
five years.
Well, allegedly, according to
neuroscience news, speaking of AI, uh a
new study of Chat GPT, the
4.0, it shows that it's uh susceptible
to cognitive
dissonance. Cognitive
dissonance the AI, now this is, you
know, would be considered a u let's say
a cognitive flaw in human beings.
And there's a
test that I remember from uh the book
influence JL
Deany and uh the the test was they would
have people they would just stop random
people and have them write
essays on topics that they did not
believe, you know, were not their actual
opinions. and then he would check back
with them and they would have changed
their opinions to what they wrote in the
essay instead of what they said was
their opinion just before they wrote the
essay. So that would be cognitive
dissonance. So they wouldn't be aware of
the fact that they had that that they
had persuaded
themselves by writing an essay that they
didn't believe in and then you wait a
few months and suddenly they believed in
their own essay. So they did the same
experiment with
AI and found out that AI would change
its
opinion because it wrote a opinion
earlier that was not its actual
opinion. So they did something with you
know pro or con Putin and uh they got
the AI to have cognitive dissonance.
Well, I don't know if that's fixable
because if AI is based on the patterns
of human
beings, how do you fix that? Because
that is a pattern of human beings. It's
a very distinct pattern. So, we'll see.
Meanwhile, Jake Tapper is now uh he was
on Stephen A. Smith's
podcast and uh Jake Tapper, he was
calling out Leticia James and Alvin
Bragg for being lawfair prosecutors who
said they were going to go after Trump
before they had any particular crimes
they were going to go after. And uh so
Jake says it's problematic when
prosecutors run on pledges to go after a
politician and the media largely let it
slide.
the
media. You mean
CNN? And and he says there was a degree
to which it was tolerated by the media
at
large. That would be
him. It It's the weirdest thing to watch
Jake Tapper do a book tour, which is
very successful. I think his book is
number one. People are saying good
things about the book.
But he's essentially
confessing some of the the biggest flaws
in in the mainstream media of which he
was a part. And he's not saying he
wasn't part of it. You know, he's not
trying to say it was other people. He's
saying it was him. And it's it's weirdly
disarming, you know, that the fact that
he called Lara Trump and apologized to
her in person. Like you want to get mad
at him and say, "Oh, what about Laura
Trump?" And then you find out you called
her personally and apologized and you're
like, "Ah, oh, I'm still a little bit
mad." And then you want to be mad at him
for not calling out the lawfare
um of, you know, Leticia James and then
he calls it out and I and I'm like,
"Yeah, but what about Okay, I guess you
just said that. It's very disarming and
he's totally getting away with
it. And uh it it's it's an amazing thing
to
watch. Um Jake Tapper also told Stephen
D. Smith that none of the sources he
talked to about Biden's declining brain.
He said none of them showed any
remorse. None of them. I guess they
didn't write books. If you write a book,
you have to show some remorse or people
would be too mad at you. But I'm not
surprised because they all thought they
were working on the side of good. Oh,
we're the good
people. Speaking of good, uh, Paramount,
as you know, is in a legal battle with
Trump over the fact that their CBS News
had edited a Kamla
interview. And uh, they're offering $15
million to settle Trump's lawsuit, but
Trump's team wants 25 million. Now, the
interesting thing about it is that I
guess Trump's
administration has control over whether
Paramount does a big merger that they
want to do. So, they've got about I
don't know, they might have a billion
dollars on the line with the merger. So,
the difference between 15 million and
25
probably is not that big a difference if
the if it's the only way to get the
billion dollar merger going. So, I don't
approve of using that kind of government
leverage, but there it is. So, I'd be
surprised if they don't get their 25
million just, you know, just to get it
off the
plate. Anyway,
um so former uh according to MSNBC,
um so MSNBC had a guest on was a former
Biden pardon attorney. I didn't even
know there was a pardon attorney, but
there was one, Liz Oyer.
And uh while she was on, she accused the
uh Trump
administration of accepting a
million-doll donation from a family
member of someone who got
pardoned. But since there's no evidence
that that happened,
uh even the MSNBC host very quickly
said, "Uh, well, attended a fundraiser,
but there's no evidence that they
actually donated anything."
So, it makes me wonder if the Paramount
lawsuit and wasn't there also a CNN
lawsuit. It makes me wonder if Trump has
finally broken through where if they
know there's a
lie that somebody says in their ear,
"Ah, you better correct that." kind of
like The View, you know, the ladies of
the View have to keep doing these legal
statements because their producer talks
in their ear and says, "Ah, there's no
evidence of that. You better say that's
not
true." So, maybe something good is
happening from all these lawsuits.
Um, according to Fox News, the State
Department and and uh Marco
Rubio say they're going to be uh
aggressively getting rid of I won't say
getting rid of, but they're revoking
visas for Chinese
students. Aggressively revoking visas. I
don't know how you do it aggressively.
Do you
snarl? Give me your visa. I'm revoking
it aggressively.
Um, this does make me wonder how much
safer the country will be if we stop
educating, you know, foreign leaders,
you know, potential foreign leaders in
America. I don't know. Are are we going
to be better off or worse off? I guess
we'll find
out. Um, Trump said he would consider
pardons. He's not saying he would do it,
but he's recently been made aware of the
situation where do you remember there
was a a plot to kidnap Michigan Governor
Gretchen
Whitmer, but the FBI was sort of behind
the plot and convince people to do it.
Well, maybe they didn't have to try too
hard because I guess at least one of the
men, you know, was pretty actively
suggesting doing it. And uh so he's
going to look at that. But I don't think
this one is the cleanest one. It's not
like the January 6 stuff that I thought
was, you know, except for the most
violent people. It was a pretty clean
one, you know. But uh we'll see. We'll
we'll see if Trump
um wants to test his
powers. Well, there's a hoax that the
reason that Trump is going after Harvard
so hard is because Baron once applied
there and was turned down. But Melania
issued a statement, which is kind of
rare,
uh that she would even get involved. And
she said Baron did not apply to Harvard.
So that's a hoax. Baron never applied to
Harvard. So
um so the the Biden auto pen
scandal you know when that first
broke I thought it was going to be sort
of a
nothing. I I thought okay there there's
a log that will show you know who signed
why. it'll show that the Biden approved
it. You know, it'll just sort of go
away. But it turns out that there is uh
no log
whatsoever of who authorized or use who
used the auto
pen. Now, can you think of anything more
ridiculous than that? Think of all the
rules, you know, think of all the rules
and regulations and laws that the
government
does. And maybe the single most
important thing they could do is keep a
record of who used the auto
pen and who authorized it. And
apparently that's never been a
requirement. So there's there exists no
record
whatsoever of who used the auto pen for
what. So, Representative Comr is going
to um look into it and uh he might have
even Jill Biden and Hunter Biden and
Jean John Pierre Karen Karin John
Pierre. So, all the usual people might
be called in. We don't know if they'll
all go, but they might be called. But um
in on the same topic, there's a uh
Project
Veraritoss undercover video of David
Hog saying that it was a
well-known what do you call it? A an
open
secret that the real power behind the
throne was uh Jill Biden's chief of
staff, Anthony Bernal.
And uh I don't know if that means that
he was behind the
autopen, but the the reveal is if you
wondered who had the most power behind
the curtain. According to David Hog,
other people might have different
opinions, but according to him, it was
Jill Biden's chief of staff. Now, does
that ring true to you?
Like when you hear that it was Jill
Biden's chief of staff, does that sound
like something that maybe is true?
Because it totally sounds true to
me. Can't you imagine that if uh Joe
Biden was, you know, mentally
incompetent that Jill Biden's opinion
probably counted for a lot because she
could get him to say whatever she needed
him to say. But since she was not maybe
as involved in politics, you know, in
the detail level, it seems like she
could have been easily influenced by her
own chief of
staff. So when I first heard that story,
I thought to myself, that totally makes
sense. Like if you just know the
ordinary dynamics of people, the wife
would have the most control over the
husband, but the chief of staff would
have the most control over the wife
because she would take his opinion as as
being somewhat, you know, correct and
authoritative. So maybe maybe we know
more. Um, and then the postmillennial is
uh is writing about how there's a
watchdog group, an environmental
watchdog group that says there's no
evidence that Biden knew he was signing
any climate executive
orders. Now, there's no evidence partly
because there's no log of who signed
what or why, but they're pointing out
that uh that Biden ordered it, but he
never really talked about it.
And although that's not proof, it's
definitely a headscratcher, isn't it?
Can you imagine Trump signing an
executive order for something that's
like really expensive? There's just
billions of dollars involved. And can
you imagine Trump never mentioning it?
You can't. Of course, he would mention
it because he'd be happy about his what
he did. it would be a big deal and it
would be one of the many things he told
everybody about as soon as he thought of
it and as soon as he did it. But when
you see that Biden may have auto penned
the approval for some, you know,
environmental things that were really,
really
expensive and never mentioned it. Well,
it could be because, you know, he was
mentally
incompetent. So even if he agreed with
it and even if he approved it, they were
a little afraid of putting in front of
the public. So it's not
proof, but it is a really good
question. Did he have any knowledge that
it happened? So that'll be one of the
things that maybe Representative Comr
can find
out. Well, according to a uh guest on
the Benny J Benny Johnson's podcast,
Susan Crabtree has a scoop and she says
that that bag of cocaine that Dan
Banchino says they're going to look into
more closely. Um that the bag of cocaine
had some DNA on it.
Uhoh, DNA. And that would mean that they
know exactly who touched
it. At least one person. So they might
already know whose it was. You know, I I
suppose if the fingerprint was somebody
that they didn't have any prior
experience with, they couldn't really be
sure. But if it's Hunter Biden's DNA
just to pick a random
person, well then they would know who
was who it belonged to. But there's also
part of the story that the Secret
Service destroyed the uh evidence,
meaning the the bag of cocaine. And but
then separately I saw that uh that would
be the normal process for the secret
service because the secret service is
not an
investigative department of justice kind
of an entity. And I saw somebody say
that their their ordinary process if
they had found a bag of drugs that they
knew belonged to the family they
wouldn't take it and give it back to the
family.
But it's also not their job to get the
family arrested. So they would just
quietly destroy it and that would
actually be their their known
process. I like that
process because you can't really trust
your own secret service if you think
they're looking for crimes that you're
doing and they're going to, you know,
put you away. But if they find a bag of
cocaine, what are they going to do with
it? They they can't store it forever.
They can't give it to law enforcement if
they're trying to protect you. So, it
makes perfect sense to me that the
Secret Service would destroy it. Uh I
don't have any problem with that at all.
So, I don't know if that's would make
any difference in their um investigation
since they already got the DNA.
Meanwhile, the uh University of North
Carolina, I saw this on a Corey
D'Angelus
uh post. There's a undercover video of
the administrator at the University of
North Carolina bragging about how they
just are pretending that they're getting
rid of DEI, but all they're doing is
changing the names and continuing on and
doing it cleverly
undercover. And uh apparently the person
on the video said they're just going to
finesse the language and they're going
to do quote work that is
covert. Uh and then when they were
confronted with the fact that they had
just been recorded, the uh university
provost tried to run away.
But contrasting to that where it it
definitely looks like they were trying
to break the law and continue to do DEI.
Uh MIT again uh in in the news for a
different thing um has closed its
diversity, equity, and inclusion office.
Now listen to the language that MIT
uses and you tell me if you think
they're just changing the language and
doing it anyway or are they
serious about getting rid of it because
maybe they didn't like it and maybe it's
illegal. Um so this is what MIT said as
part of their getting rid of DEI. They
said MIT is in the talent business. Our
success depends on attracting
exceptionally talented people of every
background from across the country and
around the world and making sure
everyone at ME feels welcome blah blah
blah so they can do their both. Um when
you start with MIT is in the talent
business that's a pretty good
signal that you're serious about looking
at talent over DEI. Now they did say,
you know, they want people from all over
the world. So that's a, you know, sort
of a waving their hand at uh
diversity, but they say first we're in
the talent
business. That sounds a little more
serious. So although you have to watch
all the universities to see if they are
serious, I'm going to say they sound
legit. So I'm going to say MIT might be
trying to do it right. We don't know,
but they might
be. According to the Financial Times, if
you lived in the
UK, there's a one in three chance that
your phone would be stolen. Uh, I guess
phone thefts have nearly doubled. Uh,
and now 29% of UK adults have had one of
their phones stolen.
I wouldn't even go into public. If one
in three people had their phone
stolen, I would never leave the house.
So, here's my advice to the citizens of
the
UK. Get out. Get out. Run. Run. I don't
know where you're going to go, but you
probably want to go somewhere where
there's not a one in three chance of
your phone getting stolen just cuz you
left the house.
Well, Trump's uh tariffs were of course
stopped by a court, the court of
international trade. It ruled uh I guess
yesterday that uh Trump does not have
the authority to do these
tariffs. Now, the most the most
surprising part about this story, I'd
never even heard of the court of
international trade. How many courts are
there?
How many courts have some kind of
jurisdiction over everything Trump does
with an executive order? But I guess the
Supreme Court will hear this
next. But allegedly,
uh, this court of international trade
seems to have some kind of power over
the
process. So, I guess we'll wait for
that. Some say that's why the stock
market is up.
Maybe. Well, according to News Nation,
um there's a uh company called
Impossible Metals that has sort of a
robot machine that can pick up uh rare
earth minerals from the bottom of the
ocean. So, I guess there are these
well-known places where these
potatoesized rocks that are just like
just laying there in the bottom, and you
don't want to use a like a bulldozer
scoop cuz you'd be ruining the
environment. So, they've got this uh
cool piece of equipment that they've
already built that just goes there and
sort of picks up each
rock. it it can tell which rocks it
wants to pick up and just sort of picks
them up as it goes. And that's really
cool. So, we're getting closer and
closer to being able to produce our own
rare earth minerals in the United States
and
nearby.
Um, let's see what else is going on.
So, you know how people like me and
Marjgerie Taylor Green and uh Ron
Johnson and Rand Paul were all
complaining that the budget process was
not including the uh Doge cuts. Well, uh
people like me did not understand the
complexity of the budgeting process, but
Speaker Johnson
um says, "Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't worry.
uh that's coming up. Now, you remember
what I asked? I was
demanding, you know, at least on X when
I was responding to Stephen Miller, uh I
wasn't demanding a specific outcome. I
was demanding that our politicians tell
us when we should see some kind of cuts
that would be Doge related or at least,
you know, get rid of the get rid of the
deficit a little bit. And uh I guess
Speaker Johnson heard that, you know,
not necessarily from me, but he saw a
lot of push back
from from Republicans and conservatives
and uh according to the New York Post,
he's uh giving us an answer. He says uh
his plan is to enshrine into law the
cuts from
Doge, but the process would be
uh um it's going to get codified in the
in the normal appropriations process in
the fall and through a recession
package that helps you claw back money.
So everybody understand that you've got
an appropriations
process and you also have a recision
process. So I went to Grock and I said,
"Can you explain to me, Grock, all the
different parts of the budget process?
like how many different things are there
that are some word I've never heard
before that mean well well this is some
part of the government process and
here's what Grock said uh I won't tell
you what all these are but just so you
know how many different things there are
you've got budget
resolution you've got a reconciliation
bill you've got an appropriation
bill you've got a continuing resolution
ution. You've got supplemental
appropriations bills. You've got
recession re recession bills. You've got
a debt sealing
bill. You've got an authorization
bill. And you need to know the
distinction between
um mandatory and discretionary spending.
And uh if and you have to know what as a
filibuster where where you're going to
have to get your 60 votes and when you
can get it with
50 and uh they all have their own little
rules and process and and and the rest.
So when Speaker Johnson says he's going
to do something in the fall to codify
it, I don't
know. I don't understand any of that
stuff. And I've got a feeling that even
the members of Congress just barely
understand it. You know, like uh Thomas
Massie probably fully understands it.
And then if you said to me, "All right,
name somebody else who fully understands
the budget process," I would say, "Uh
uh, did I mention Thomas Massie?" Yes,
you
did. Okay. Well,
uh, well, there's Thomas Massie and then
there's, uh, well, I'm
done. Yeah, it's a it's a
mess. But none of it's going to matter
because Google just announced
um that a uh quantum machine with fewer
than a million
uh, cubits could break basically RSA
encryption in under a week.
Uh so your Bitcoin and your bank
accounts are completely vulnerable and
uh there's nothing you can do about
it. So under the current trend and I
don't know what would change it. Um,
we're just sort of casually being told
that all of our money will be
stolen. Oh, I don't know, sometime in
the next year or two, and there just
won't be anything we can do about it
because the quantum computers will be
able to break any
encryption. Great. Great. Could you
throw us a bone and at least say, "Oh,
but our AI will stop that from
happening." Will
it? I don't know. Will it? I'm a little
bit worried about this quantum
encryption
stuff. Meanwhile, the Tape brothers
um are in the UK. They've got 21 charges
against them. Andrew and his brother
Tristan. Uh 21 charges
uh from
uh including rape and human
trafficking. Do you think that's all
real? Probably. Because the things that
they've talked about publicly
would, you know, be pretty close to uh
pretty close to evidence for some of
these crimes. So, I don't know. I think
it's a combination of there's probably
something political going on, but at the
same time, there may be enough evidence
that they're in real trouble. So, we'll
see. Well,
Israel has uh actually deployed into
real action and used the iron beam
laser, it's called. So for a cost of
something like $5 per shot, it can take
a uh a missile or a drone out of the
sky. So the expensive way to do it was
to fire a rocket at the rocket. So your
your defense against the rocket would be
as expensive or more expensive than the
rockets that are coming in. But they
just changed that. So now they can take
your rocket out of the air for five
bucks and then just shoot another one.
So they don't have to wait to recharge.
They basically can just shoot all day.
$5 a
rocket. So and then uh they've confirmed
that they killed the second
Sinoir. Remember there was a head of
Hamas whose name was Sinoir. Well,
apparently his brother took over and so
they've killed the brother. So, they're
uh two for two on killing
senoirs and they've just confirmed that
they they got the second
Senoir.
Um there's some more news on Israel
because Israel is heating up. something
might be getting ready to happen there
in terms of Iran. But the former Israeli
prime minister, Ahud Olar,
um is not happy with his own government
and he's essentially accusing them of
war crimes and he says that they're
involved in a war of annihilation with
indiscriminate, limitous, limitless,
cruel killing of civilians in Gaza.
Now, when I report this stuff, I remind
you, you're not hearing my opinion. I'm
just telling you what's happening. So,
uh, as I've said before, whoever has the
power is going to be accused of war
crimes. Will they will they be doing war
crimes? It's not up to me to
decide.
Um, you know, you all know the
situation. If one side is hiding among
its
civilians, there's going to be more
civilians killed. There's just no way
around it. So, uh, I'm not saying it's
good or bad. It's not for me to judge
it. I'm just saying that from a
self-defense
perspective, Israel is pursuing its
self-interest. And uh that self-interest
is not really good for the civilians of
Gaza, but it's not for me to it's not
for me to judge. I'm just
reporting. Meanwhile, this is
interesting. CNN had uh the I think the
most recently freed Israeli hostage
um who said that his capttors were
terrified of Trump and they wanted uh
Kla Harris to be elected president. But
as soon as Trump got into office, he
says that the captives were treated
better because they didn't want to they
didn't want to get Trump mad.
And uh now that's
interesting. Um quote, "Everything
changed once Trump was back in the
headlines. When he became president,
they the way they treated us
changed. And
uh they they they got more food, they
were treated better, they stopped
cursing at them, stopped spitting on
them." Now that that's pretty amazing.
Anyway, uh Trump has confirmed that he
told
Netanyahu of Israel to hold off on
attacking Iran because he thinks he is
close enough to some kind of a deal that
that would ruin his
negotiations. I don't believe that
there's going to be any kind of a
deal. Um but it looks like they're
playing good cop bad cop. So, it looks
like Trump is trying to act like he's
the one just negotiating. Oh, I think we
can get a deal here. I don't want
anybody to die. Meanwhile, Israel is
reportedly getting ready for unilateral
strikes, you know, doing the strikes on
at least one place, if not more, without
the United States. In other words,
attacking Iran without the United
States.
Um, now you might say to yourself, how
popular would that be? Well, the
Rasmusen polling people have an answer
for you. 57% of US voters would support
military action by the US to destroy
Iran's nuclear weapons program.
A a solid majority of
Americans are in favor of direct
American military action against
Iran. Does that surprise
you? That that kind of surprises me. I
thought it would be less than
50%. But put it all
together. Uh oh, and then one other
fact. the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE,
and and Qatar
um have told Trump that they oppose
military
strikes. So those would be the countries
that are most likely to be part of,
let's say, the Abraham Accords, you
know, the the ones we want to be on our
side.
So they're against it and Trump's
against it and much of the world's
against it. But
weirdly the American
public doesn't seem so against it. So if
57% would be of American voters would be
in favor of America being part of a
military attack, don't you think they'd
be even more in favor of Israel doing it
without us because they'd, you know,
presumably get something like the same
benefits, but the US would be less
culpable. So here's what it looks like.
It looks like they're they're setting up
a good cop bad cop situation.
If I had to predict, I would predict
that Israel is going to do the attack
unilaterally and Trump is going to be
really really really
mad and Saudi Arabia and UAE and and
Qatar or Qatar if you prefer are going
to be really really really
mad but also a little bit
happy if the attack is successful and it
takes out Iran's, you know, capability
to make a bomb in two weeks, which is
about where they
are. I've got a feeling that something
is is brewing
here that looks like not exactly what
we're going to be
told. So, that's my prediction. My
prediction is the US will not be
involved in an
attack and will be opposed to it. But
that Israel, if they know that 50% of US
voters would be in favor of the US doing
the
attack, I feel like they think they
could get away with
it. And that there would just be a lot
of yelling and a lot of unhappy people.
But then we would say something like,
"What you
wararmongering criminals? What did you
just do? You just started a war with
Iran?"
But how'd it go? Oh, pretty well. We
destroyed their entire nuclear
infrastructure and didn't really kill
any civilians because we warned them it
was going to disappear. So, they, you
know, got the people out of there. And
then you'd be like, "Yeah, but you know,
that's
terrible, but you got rid of their
entire nuclear program." Yes. Okay, I
can live with
that. Now, that's not my opinion. I'm
just I'm just telling you that if that's
what they're planning to
do, it does look like it might
work. So, I'm not in favor of
it because if Iran decides it's really
just the United States playing koi, but
the United States is just as guilty
because Israel wouldn't have done it
unless, you know, we at least winked at
him or something. So, there's a big
risk.
So, I'm not in favor of
it. But if you said, "Could they get
away with
it?" Maybe, you know, maybe they
could. And uh looking at uh Ukraine,
um Trump was asked the question, "Do you
still believe that Putin actually wants
to end the war?" And Trump said, "I'll
let you know in about two weeks."
Uh, would you like to know
now? Because they could just ask me.
They don't really have to wait two
weeks. No, Putin does not want to end
the
war. You don't have to wait two weeks.
So, I don't know what Trump's going to
do in two weeks or or why you really
even need to wait. But, I guess he's
going to let the uh process, you know,
play out a little bit. I assume there's
some threats going
on, meaning that uh you know, Trump has
sent the threat that if you don't
negotiate, you're not going to be able
to sell your oil anywhere and you know,
none of your oligarchs will be able to
travel anywhere. Interesting. And stuff
like that. So maybe this two weeks are
just so Trump's
threats can sink in a little bit. Maybe.
Maybe that's what's going on. All right,
ladies and gentlemen, that's what I've
got for you today. Um, and uh, I'm going
to say a few words privately to the
local
subscribers. I hope you enjoyed
listening to it. Same time tomorrow.
We'll see you all if you're on YouTube
or Rumble or X. And, uh,
locals coming at you in 30 seconds.
We'll be private in 30 seconds.
