yes it's all working let me check your stocks
a little bit up let's see what Tesla's doing
tesla is a little bit up all right and looks like we're we're going to have
a good weekend that's my prediction
let's get our comments working here there there we go
good morning everyone and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to try to take this
experience up to levels that no one can even understand with their tiny shiny
human brains all you need for that is a copper mug or a glass of tankered
shell or stein a canteen jug or flask of a vessel of any kind fill it with your
favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure to
join the end of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called That's right the simultaneous sip go
all right Paul i see the real the real one
don't try that fake one with me again all right what's going on i find that um
the first part of the news is always something about Elon Musk
is there even one day that guy can go without making news
it's impossible but apparently on Sunday this Sunday in
Austin Texas um will be the launch of the Tesla robo
taxi so the no driver um self-driving
taxi in Austin and I saw a picture of somebody in one and they were sitting in
the front would you sit in the front of a robo
taxi in the front seat or would you sit in the back in case
something goes wrong i feel like I feel like I would sit in the back seat if
that's an option i assume it is wouldn't you you know just a little bit safer
at least for a while now I I get that the self-driving robo taxis will be
safer than a human-driven automobile but even with a human I don't feel
comfortable in the in the passenger side of the front seat i always think can I
trust this human so I'd probably send him back
well according to uh the ex CEO which is not someone who used to be a
CEO but rather the CEO of the company called X um
so Linda is saying that uh users will soon be able to trade stocks on X and
make investments and send tips and split bills and maybe even buy merch uh all
without leaving the app and they're going to call it X Money so it'll be a
peer-to-peer payment system now here's the fun part
if X becomes the everything account
isn't X an internet within the internet because I asked myself what do I do all
day on the internet that I could not do completely within X i use AI all right
well that's built into X i look at the news
but all the links and the analysis are on X
so the only other thing I do is investments and send money digitally
that's the only other stuff I do so if I could do all of that on X
I would be within a internet that was within an internet
and do you know how much power that would give Elon Musk if if he had an
internet within the internet and you never left it you would be in the bubble of all
bubbles now I get you know I get that uh X has
different points of view but I don't really see them do you
i I could spend the entire day on X and never see a competing point of view all
I would see is the people that I most like to see the the only times I see
competing points of view is when they're being mocked by people I agree with so
when I see a clip on MSNBC it's never to agree with it it's always
to laugh at it if I see a clip of the view it's always just a laugh at it so the
the bubble of all bubbles is forming i don't know if I'm against it or for it
but it's it's a complete transformation of the internet experience if you never
leave that one app and I probably wouldn't i' I'd probably be on it all day
anyway um and then uh Elon Musk's AI company
which I assume will be folded into X into Grock i don't know how that works
but apparently uh Elon Musk is now launching the biggest supercomputer in
the world uh the largest supercomput has many GPUs you don't need to know the
details but the biggest one in the world is uh Elon Musk's so
if you if you used AI for all of your work
and Elon Musk had the largest supercomputer driving the best AI
would you ever leave i don't know it's looking to me like um
Elon Musk's strategy for X and for everything else is kind of
amazing it's like a strategy I've never seen before that basically would take over
everything from the news to finance to banking um and probably probably it
would work so that's big
speaking of Elon Musk he points out that the solar power generation in China will
exceed all sources of electricity combined in the USA in only 3 to four
years which he calls a wakeup call so do you remember when people mocked uh Elon
Musk for saying that we could get all of our energy from solar we would need
batteries of course but we have batteries um
he he was never really in the majority on that i always felt like he was in the
minority and everyone who thought they knew about energy would say over and
over "Well you're never going to get there with solar power alone." I mean
that's that's ridiculous you're going to need nuclear and you're going to need
oil and gas and all that and in the short run certainly that's all true but
is it hypothetically possible as Musk has been saying for years that
if you wanted to and you went hard at it you could have all the energy needed
from solar and it's starting to look like he was right about that looks like he got the
math right if you were doubting Elon Musk on math and engineering
well he made a bad bet i have to admit I was skeptical because
it looked more like he was just promoting his own products but I think he's also accurate that you
could get all of your electricity from solar if you went wild you know really
went at it hard like China um the appeals court an appeals court is
going to let Trump keep control of the California National Guard now if you
haven't been following this um how many times have you heard that an
appeals court altered an order from a lower court about something about Trump
how many times have we seen that story in in just this calendar year maybe
25 times about different stories i don't know how many times but it feels like a
lot but the latest one is let's see um so
Trump took control of the National Guard in California when those anti-ICE
protests were happening and then uh California appealed and said "You
can't do that you don't have the right to do that because there are only certain circumstances in which the
commander-in-chief can take control and those certain circumstances have not
been met and the lower court agreed and so for a while Gavin Newsome had control
back of the National Guard but now the appeals court has uh decided that the
commander-in-chief should have flexibility and you don't want to handicap them and
you don't want to put the state in charge of the protecting the whole country so the the appeals court says
that Trump can keep control of the National Guard in California
but um does it matter are we still having protests anti-CE
protests in LA or did they all stop because I didn't see anything in the
news today about any protests so I think the appeals court has ruled on something
that has no no importance and no bearing on anything because it's already old news
anyway speaking of complicated things uh Russ
Vote the uh budget budget guy for the administration
uh according to Politico he's got this uh clever idea for cutting costs in the
government that not everybody thinks is legal and he calls it a pocket recession
so as you know the budget process in the government is this weird convoluted
Byzantine process that nobody understands sometimes it's a budget sometimes it's a spending bill and
sometimes it's a recession and we don't even know what any of that means
but there's a idea that uh Trump could issue a formal request to claw back
funding now this is in Politico and so
if Trump said um I I've got a formal request to you know end funding for some
specific things similar to what he did before with a $9.4 billion package he
sent to lawmakers that uh what you could do is have it sit there
uh the memo could land on Capitol Hill less than 45 days before the new fiscal
year is set to begin in October 1st and then by withholding the cash see if see
if he can follow all this by withholding the cash for that full uh
time frame uh regardless of the action by Congress the White House would treat
the funding as expired when the current fiscal year ends
so something about a formal request to claw back funding but you don't really
mean it you just want the request to sit there and time out and then somehow it
times out and then you don't have to spend it does that even sound like a real process
to you i I may be getting some part of that wrong
but it's it's so frustrating that our government doesn't have a process that
the that the voters even understand it's like why don't you do your budget like
everybody else does where you say "This is how much I want to spend does
everybody agree?" And then you vote on it no no we've got to have recision
packages and spending packages we've got to have pocket recisions
yeah so we'll see if that works anyway um I saw one report today on X
that uh there's a senior Iranian official who told Reuters that Iran is
ready to discuss uh limitations on its uranium enrichment
to which I say one guy there's one guy who said that
what good is that if it wasn't the Supreme Leader do we trust this one guy
who allegedly told Reuters "Oh yeah we're totally totally open to discussing
our uranium enrichment." Well at the same time also an ex
I think Zero Edge was reporting this uh another senior Iranian official who is
different from the last one um said zero enrichment will undoubtedly
be rejected especially now because of the Israeli strikes so you got one
Iranian official who says "Oh yeah we'll totally discuss that." and another one
who says "Oh no we're not even going to be open to that." But it could be that
one of them is talking about zero enrichment and the other one is talking about limitations on enrichment
so you don't really need to get to zero do you um could you make a deal where
it's just low enrichment levels are allowed as long as there's lots of inspections
so maybe there's some room to deal with that
according to uh NBC Iran has unleashed what they call combat
drones inside Israel for the first time now combat drone
what would be a combat drone versus a drone i don't know exactly but I think a drone
would be like a smart rocket but not very fast and it would uh plunge into something
and explode whereas I'm guessing these combat drones are more like an unmanned
jet that has a number of weapons and it can go in and fire a bunch of things and
then return home and get some more ordinance i like saying ordinance makes
me sound like I know what I'm talking about anyway the Revolutionary Guard has
announced that uh its drones have penetrated Israeli airspace and it's
they're hitting infrastructure using missiles and airdrop bombs
so that's what it sounds like a pilotless aircraft
um meanwhile on X and other places I keep
seeing these estimates of how many missiles Iran had and how many they've
used and how many guys shot down and for about five minutes I said to
myself "Huh here's some useful data."
I I told myself if I know how many missiles Iran has and I know how many
they fired and how many they have left and what percentage of them are getting through I have a good idea what's going
to happen and my current opinion is it doesn't matter
uh but here's what matters iran is never going to surrender unless
there are boots on the ground meaning Israeli and American soldiers on the
ground and that's not going to happen i'm pretty sure i mean it seems deeply
unlikely that Trump would agree to you know soldiers getting killed on the
ground in Iran and of course Iran is a much bigger harder
land target than Iraq was by by a lot so
we don't think it would work and if you don't put people on the ground
are we really going to change the leadership in Iran and if we don't
change the leadership um is anything going to be different you
know once the bombs start stop dropping so it seems to me like we're on a path
to destroying as much of Iran as you can from the air at least the government and
military stuff but then when it's all done we won't
have anybody on the ground i'm positive that there will not be a legitimate
organic uh rising up of the population of Iran to take over with a moderate i feel like
that's a zero chance i I just don't see a world in which your nation is being
targeted and bombed all day long and you say to yourself you know what I think
I'll take the side of the people bombing my country even if you like the West and even if
you didn't like your Ayatollah you're still not going to rise up against your own country and take the side of the
country that's bombing you has that ever happened in the history of
anything i don't think so so if we're not going to have soldiers
on the ground which I don't think we will and there won't be any kind of you
know organic national uprising that means that either the Supreme
Leader will still be in power when this is over or maybe somebody worse who's
just you know down the line if the if the Supreme Leader gets taken out he's
not going to be replaced by a moderate probably replaced by somebody who's the
you know hardest hard ass they have so what exactly would be the way that we
could have any kind of victory here it it looks to me like there's only one
way this all works out if we're not going to put boots in the ground Iran
will still be Iran when we're done and then they will start rebuilding their
offensive weapons presumably because they think it's their best chance of survival
so I just don't see a path
do you do any of you see like how this could possibly be settled in a way that
we would all be happy and when I say all I mean everybody except Iran i feel like
everybody's going to be unhappy including Iran so that's what it looks like but
Starlink is still live in Iran everything's about Elon Musk um so Iran
has turned off its regular internet service but the people who have Starlink
I don't know how many there are but they do have full internet thanks to Elon
Musk's Starlink company now that's something that apparently uh Iran can't
turn off because they don't have any control over the satellites in the air
so that would suggest that at least uh Israel and the US could feed a bunch of
propaganda into their population but there won't be that many people who have a Starlink right and I imagine that if
you did have a Starlink and the Iranian authorities found out wouldn't they
arrest you or take your Starlink base platform away so I don't think Starlink
will have a gigantic impact on the population of Iran because there can't
be that many people have access to it and even if they did as I said before
you're not going to you're not going to convince the population to rise up against their own leader while you're
bombing them it just isn't a thing it just couldn't possibly happen in our world
anyway over on MSNBC um there was uh some talking head who
was arguing that when the the Iranians chant death to America
uh that they don't really mean it and his example was that he was at some
event where they were chanting death to America and then he introduced himself
to some of the locals and the locals said "Oh we love America we like your
movies." and your culture and all that and so he concluded
that death to America doesn't really mean you know death to America it's just
a thing they say to which I say it doesn't really matter
what the public wanted it only matters what the leadership means when they say death to America right it doesn't matter
how many people repeat it they don't have any power so what matters is do the top people in
Iran the top military the top supreme leader when they say death to America do
they mean death to America or is it just something they say while they're loving
Western culture well no the Supreme Leader is not loving Western culture
so anything that the population says about how much they love America which I
do believe you know all all indications are that the Iranians are at least pro-
western culture if not pro-America um I don't think it matters i think it
only matters what the leaders think and if they want to destroy America and Israel well they'll keep doing it
um the Pentagon according to Jennifer Griffin Fox News the Pentagon is very
confident that the bunker buster missiles would work if employed
and apparently they're GPSG guided and if one doesn't get the job done they
can drop a second one in the same hole as the first one and uh it'll make the
hole deeper and that'll get the job done now let me ask you this
when was the last time you saw a very complicated system that had never been
tested work on the first try well maybe the nuclear bombs that we
dropped on Japan um but you could argue that
had we tested those we tested those before we dropped them right not the ones we dropped but were did the
Manhattan Project test the explosions with other bombs
before they went after Japan um I should know that it it was tested
right i feel like we would have tested it but how in the world have we tested
dropping two bombs in the same hole does that sound like something we could
you know be sure is going to work it It would be one thing if we said
it'll probably work so it's worth a try but they're not really saying probably
are they they're they're the Pentagon is basically saying "Oh this will work." Do
you believe that so I would say that the the chance that
it doesn't work or it doesn't work completely or it doesn't work enough or
something goes wrong they're pretty high pretty high because in the real world
when you you haven't tested something that's complicated and it's kind of
complicated to fly a bomber all across the ocean and refuel it multiple times
um drop one bomb and then drop a second one in the same hole
while the Iranians are watching and I guess they would have no defense against any of that
well let me just say that I don't think it's guaranteed i don't know what the odds are but I
would put the odds at maybe 70% that it would work
what would you do tell me in the comments if you had to guess without
knowing anything you know none of us really know anything about this topic but knowing that it's complicated and
there's technology involved and there's war and when war is involved nothing
goes exactly the way you planned what would you guess are the odds it would work
uh I say 100% 25% well you're just joking on the 25 99% yeah we don't know
do we it's an unknowable estimate i don't think the Pentagon knows
uh but they they use words like this that it would definitely work if it were
deployed correctly uh do you see what they're doing if
deployed correctly that's the problem
i I I'm actually confident that they know how to make a bomb that makes a big hole that part I believe I believe the
bomb will explode so I don't really have a lot of doubt about that there's I mean there's some
uncertainty but very low the the uncertainty is whether we implement it correctly
so So they've got that little uh that little catch in there oh yeah this is
it's 100% gonna work if deployed correctly
wouldn't that be everything everything works if deployed correctly
it's sort of like saying nothing anyway
according to the uh Wall Street Journal uh Israel is spending hundreds of millions
of dollars a day supporting this war which would explain why they wanted it
to end in two weeks but do you remember one of my
predictions that it would not end in two weeks now Trump has said he needs two weeks
from now to make a decision because the Europeans are meeting to allegedly talk
about uh what can be done with Iran so
it doesn't look like Iran wants to talk to the United States or to Israel directly but they might talk to the
Europeans because the Europeans have not been as you know bellose as US and
Israel so let's say they talk to the Europeans
and that that takes two weeks before Trump decides whether he wants to get militarily aggressive on the side of
offense and so we're already at three weeks right so minimum would be three weeks
and remember two weeks is just to make a decision
if he makes a decision how much longer will it take for the you know additional
military force to make a difference so how do you like my prediction now where
Israel said we'll be done in two weeks and I said
I think probably months i think we're up to at least a month
already no matter what and I don't think we're done extending
that i've got a feeling it's going to be multiple months and whatever Israel
thought they were going to spend um they're going to spend a lot more so it's going to be billions and uh Israel
might uh I don't know they might bankrupt themselves on this war
so I guess the interceptor missiles are a major expense according to the Wall
Street Journal so the interceptor missiles cost up to
$200 million a day and then the building repairs because
Iran is knocking down buildings in Israel um are estimated at 400 million
so that's that's the kind of expense that Israel is looking at to keep doing
what they're doing and keep in mind that they could do it they could do this
forever and they still wouldn't get the result that they need without boots on the ground and there won't be boots on
the ground so they're not only spending hundreds of
millions of dollars a day but it's in an effort that even on paper
it's hard to imagine how it would work right because even if the leadership
collapses there's just going to be some new mulla doesn't mean it's going to be
better and we're not going to be on the ground
so I think Iran wins just by not losing
um if Iran just has to exist in two months and it's going to look like they
won um in a weird way i mean they'll be in terrible shape but they would be able to
rebuild and the fighting would be over and then presumably they would rebuild
some offensive capabilities anyway so Trump is still acting like
negotiations are still possible um but it's up to the Europeans at this
point uh however some people are saying that Trump isn't so much expecting the U
negotiations to work he is really just buying time for the US to move more
assets into the theater as they say does that sound right
it might be both so Trump might be thinking well you know there's some
possibility the negotiations will work so might as well give it a few weeks at
the same time he might be thinking well you know if I had another week or two we
could get a few more I don't know uh naval ships in the area or some more
some more uh ammunition or something so probably waiting makes sense but also it
could be that Israel is planning a ground attack on Ford which is the place
that we're looking at you know as bunker busters so maybe if you wait two weeks we will
know if Israel can get in the front door of these uh underground bunkers if they
have boots on the ground limited it'd be like special forces
um and just to do that one job and then presumably go home as soon as they're done
so so the we've got at least uh two or three things that might be happening in
two weeks uh more assets getting into the war zone for the US uh Israel
potentially making their own ground attack on Fordo and the other one and uh
maybe negotiations that that might lead to something so that's probably all
happening um New York Post has a story about how
all the uh once devoted Iranian proxies as they call them um are all
out of the fight so are you surprised that the uh Hezbollah and Hamas and the
Houthis and the Shiite militia um are sort of sitting this one out
um it does it does suggest that Israel did a heck of a good job in suppressing
them and I guess the US did a good job with the hoodies uh and maybe they just don't have the assets maybe they just
don't have the uh possibility of helping much so they're just going to try to sit
it out and survive but I would say the same thing about the proxies that I'm saying about Iran for
them to win they only have to survive because even though Hezbollah is acting
like you know they don't want to attack Israel they can change their mind you know once
they built up more resources but it does look like Iran is going to
be sucking for money and I don't think they're going to have much money for
their uh for their proxies so making Iran run out of money might be
the the only way you can keep them weak enough to not be uh to not be a risk
now um if anybody is new to my podcast I remind you that what I'm talking about
is predictions and observations so I'm not taking sides and I'm not
making moral or ethical judgments and I certainly don't know you know the the
military ins and outs but just uh just looking at it as an
observer trying to figure out all right what's going on here you know what do we expect
all right another topic over on Politico um there are unnamed uh Democrat people
who were criticizing their own team and uh they're calling their the DNC
chairman Ken Martin uh weak whiny and invisible
that does sound exactly like what we're saying uh that Ken Martin guy he does
seem weak whiny and invisible and he's had quite a bit of drama but uh
here here's another quote from the same article uh many DNC members and outside
Democrats including Martin supporters said they wish the party would just move
on from recent internal turmoil and focus instead on mounting an effective
fight against Trump an effective fight against Trump
you mean fighting the 80% of the country who agrees with them
how much of a loser strategy could you possibly have
i mean just think about that the the Democrats are just you know decomposing and falling apart and you know they've
got all kinds of turmoil they don't have a leader they got all these problems and then when you ask the the brightest most
informed you know most involved Democrats what do we need to do you know
the Democrats what do they need to do the answer is they need to mount a more
effective fight against Trump trump got elected because people wanted
more of his stuff that when they say they want to fight
Trump and they don't say you know we want to help the country or help the working class or any of that they're
sort of admitting that they've got nothing fighting Trump is not exactly what
anybody needs even if you thought he was wrong you
would still say "Well you know we'd rather do this plan instead of that plan."
It's unbelievable that they can't get off the fighting Trump thing that's pure
TDS so it seems that TDS doesn't just infect
individuals it seems it's infected the entire Democrat party
because as a party the way they talk is they've got to defeat Trump that's just
TDS that's not even politics but um and even Randy Weingarden who was
a member of the U DNC she was on some board she recently quit and when I asked why
she said uh um she wants the Democratic Party to work for working families
and she said that's what FDR did that's what Joe Biden did and that's what we should expect from the party so even
Randy Weine Garden the head of the biggest teachers union um and you know one of the biggest
Democrat supporters is completely aware that the party is not even focusing on
the main people that they would need to focus on to get back in power the
working class and uh then James Carville
who remains entertaining but he is one of the only Democrats who
understands what's going on i have to say as entertaining as he is and provocative as he is he at least
understands what's going on and he says that uh he said quote among other things
he was on a podcast he said "Let's face it uh Democrats acted like these people
didn't exist." He's talking about the working class they just did and uh and uh don't come
back and say um oh he says "We acted like workingass particularly workingass non-ol whites
were not part of our too cool for school group."
And Carville says there were some real high-end people that kind of bought into
that shite so is he right i think so because I do
not remember the Democrats really doing anything that would address
the working class but Trump continually did he was talking about bringing back
manufacturing and you know lowering their taxes and stuff you know even if you don't believe he would do those
things at least he was focusing on it and and the working class responded you
know they they moved to him because he was saying the things they wanted him to say
um meanwhile the uh over on MSNBC was the chief strategist for Mitt Romney
the chief strategist for Mitt Romney now that should be a disqualifying
job like like who are we going to get to put on TV how about the chief strategist
for Mitt Romney that's that's not much of a resume right there anyway
his name is Steuart Stevens he was on MSNBC and he said among other things
that Trump is the most dangerous president since the Civil War
huh the most dangerous president since the Civil War
uh is is Steuart Stevens saying that
slavery was good sort of indirectly like why would you
why would you make the cut off the Civil War because the Civil War
seems like that was when Abe Lincoln was trying to end slavery
so was Abe Lincoln the most dangerous president who wasn't Trump
why in the world would that be your where you'd put your stick in his hand and say "Oh Trump is the most dangerous
since the Civil War." That's uh that's a little weird and
crazy so I don't think he's in favor of slavery but his quote makes it sound
like he is and I guess that's what it takes to become a chief strategist for Mitt
Romney good job anyway
um so here's the here's the uh summary
of what uh Trump is doing author author authoritarian wise all right so
every day Trump wakes up at least lately
and he tries to figure out how to minimize the authoritarian regime in in
Iran and maybe the authoritarian regime in in Russia
uh or at least figure out how to deal with them and while Trump is trying to reduce the
impact of authoritarian regimes the Democrats have decided that Trump
himself is the authoritarian regime now how in the world did we get to this
place where where there's a whole bunch of TDS people who have decided that for
all kinds of invisible reasons Trump is an authoritarian and if you ask somebody
in the street well what did he do that was so authoritarian well he's shipping back the people who
are in this country illegally you mean he's following the existing law but he's
doing far less of it than Obama did so that that's the authoritarian thing he's
doing yes what else well he's doing a bunch of
executive orders okay didn't every president do executive
orders yes but he's doing more of them okay how many of those executive orders
are things that the public by a majority doesn't want and the answer is uh okay
almost everything he does by executive order is something that a majority of the public wants is that authoritarian
or is that just giving the public what they want what they're asking for
and then some of the executive orders might be reaching too far and you know
things that a president shouldn't be doing and then they go to court and then
the court decides whether he can do it and then he obeys the court
are there a bunch of examples where Trump is not obeying the court the only
one I could think of is sort of a gray area that had to do with that Maryland
dad who was uh who was shipped off to the uh El Salvador jail and even he got
shipped back now you might not like how that process worked and I can understand
that but is that it the the Maryland dad the MS-313 accused MS-13 guy that's the
one authoritarian thing he's doing that's it um
yeah so it's a it's a weird argument that he's authoritarian i like Trump's
response to that where he points out how difficult it is
for him as president to get anything done because he's got he's got resistance in his own party um right now
the MAGA people are divided on what to do about Iran so that's a limitation
um and then he's got of course the Democrats are lawfaring him on every single thing
and uh Congress is useless he can't really get them to vote for anything so
his argument that uh if he were a king he could get things done but it's just
hard to get anything done in America it's a pretty good argument pretty good so the Democrats have tied themselves
into thinking that Trump's entire day of fighting authoritarian regimes such as
Iran are are not really anything and the real problem is his own authoritarian ways
that they can't quite come up with examples of
um Netanyahu talking about uh Iran said that the the Iranian regime may fall but
that's for Iranians to decide now that's of course what you want to say in public
he says the primary goal of the war is to remove the nuclear threat secondly to
remove the ballistic missile threats and he said clearly the regime will be
destabilized in the process but it's up to the it's up to the public in Iran
whether they want to change things um I don't think they will i I'm not
seeing any I'm not seeing anything that would suggest that Iran is going to change
its uh government so so I wouldn't hold my breath on that
well General Flynn was on a podcast in which he uh he doesn't think this is the
time for Trump to attack um which is notable because you know
he's a general and he knows what he's talking about but he was on Benny Johnson's podcast and uh he said General
Flynn said "No do not do it Mr president right now is not the time now he's
talking about using the bunker busters
he says "Don't lose focus of why you were elected you have options."
And uh as General Flynn points out that it's a good strategy to have the most
options you you could have until the last minute now that's a really good summary
and it also explains Trump's strategy pretty well he wants the most options
for the longest period of time the most options for the longest period
of time and that's what the twoe delay gives them the twoe delay creates an
option that maybe Europe will will come up with a deal that the US couldn't come
up with maybe the uh Israeli forces could do something on the ground to get
into those uh underground bases so your options will and then of course
he's moving more assets into the area that increases options so Trump is very
much following this plan of keeping the most options open until
the last minute so hearing hearing that summarized by uh General Flynn is kind
of kind of good for my confidence
so we'll see um in other news I saw a post by Marina Medvin and some
other people are talking about this that apparently there's a writer for the Washington Post who once worked for Al
Jazer um who's posting the exact coordinates of successful Iranian missile strikes in
Israel um and the problem with that is that if
the Iranians are trying to you know tune their tune their missiles to be more
accurate that one of the things they would want to know is the exact place that the existing missiles hit so why
would the Washington Post feel it necessary to print the I guess the GPS
coordinates it's not like if you It's not as if when you read the newspaper
the Washington Post it's not like you're gonna say "Oh uhhuh uhhuh i see the GPS
coordinates now I know more." That would have no value to a consumer
of the Washington Post it would only It would only have value to the people who
are firing the missiles so they can know how accurate they are and adjust accordingly
now that's one point of view i think uh Bill Aman has is asking the same
questions like why are you doing that is there a reason
cuz if you don't have a reason for printing the exact GPS coordinates of the missile landings
why are you doing it um now others have said pushing back on that point of view that the Iranians
have satellite imagery and they can tell what they hit so that it's not actually
news to them but I would ask well if it doesn't help the reader of the
Washington Post because it's not like you and I are going to look at GPS coordinates and go "Ah okay yeah it's a
53424." Yeah yeah that's what I thought so there's no value to the reader
and if it were true there's no value to the Iranian regime firing the rockets
why would you do it so it's sort of an open question so my
guess is that Iran might not have the you know the ideal satellite view of the
battlefield so I don't know why assets they have but there's got to be some reason
that that that those are included in the Washington Post
um so uh former Vice President Mike Pence
is speaking up about the uh uh existential identity crisis that the
Trump supporters and the the uh political right is going through
now how many of you think that there's some kind of permanent
um Trump supporter split that's happening that will somehow you know
splinter the party and make everything not work i don't see that happening because my
take on the Republicans is that they like winning and that Trump likes
winning so if Trump figures out a way to Kobayashi Marua's situation which is
Star Trek reference to coming up with a uh nonobvious solution to a problem that
other people can't figure out how to solve if Trump somehow solves this
maybe by the Europeans coming up with some kind of agreement for you know rigorous inspections of Iran's uh
enrichment or something if he manages to solve this will there be any further
problems with his coalition no it will be one more thing that they all come
together on it's like oh okay i have to admit I didn't see that solution coming
but look what you did you did it again so if it works there will be no division
people will just say "Damn it he's good i I'm glad I voted for him i did not see
that solution coming but he made it work." That might happen the other possibility
is that everything will go to hell um in which case it's not like he's
running for office again so if everything goes to hell then all bets are off but I don't think that's so
much a you know existential identity crisis i think it's just winning is
unifying and losing is disunifying because if you look at the Democrats
their problem is not that they disagree on strategy their problem is they lost
so losing just drives you apart and winning drives you together so when
you're watching you know what will happen with Trump's supporters
uh I think Trump had the right take on that which is he said his supporters will support his his judgment basically
and you are seeing a number of people say um we have to trust Trump he knows
more about this situation than we do obviously he would have you know all the confidential information and stuff so I
am I am I think buying into the notion that if Trump did something that I
wouldn't do it doesn't mean that I'm the one who is right does anyone else have
that feeling that if Trump did something that you wouldn't do and you don't know
why it makes sense that you would give him a little bit of a break and say "All right he might know
more than I do he might be good at this he he might be you know sewing some
uncertainty intentionally." Um so I do like the fact that Trump has
created a situation where people who disagree with him on the right are still
willing to say you know what that's not what I would have done but I'm going to watch and see how this plays out
that's a really good place to be by the way that that that's sort of the
ultimate place to be because you're not going to have a situation where everybody agrees what's the best thing
to do that's just it's just not possible so what would be the best in a human
situation that you could do the best would be if people say you know I
wouldn't have done that but I'm going to let this play out because he's smarter than smarter than I am and I think
that's true for for a lot of us he's smarter than we are um
anyway uh let's see if you can guess this number according to uh Secretary Gnome
75% of illegal aliens arrested under Trump um had committed some kind of a
crime uh had been convicted of a crime
now if you're an NPC this is where you would say "Scott Scott
because that's how NPCs talk they don't talk like regular they go "Scott Scott."
They They all are criminals because they came into the country illegally they're all criminals scott Scott Scott
so if you're an NPC I'll give you a few minutes to say to say the most obvious thing you could say which is whenever we
talk about criminal non-citizens you feel is necessary to remind us as if
we didn't know that coming into the country is itself illegal
so get it out of your system i know some of you need to do it so just put it in
the comments scott Scott they're all criminals they're all criminals i get it
i get it anyway 25%
uh apparently do not fit the category of uh the worst first so they had not been
convicted of crimes now I don't know if um committed or convicted of crimes is
the right standard because there you go all caps Scott they are all illegal
there the NPCs are weighing in on the comments now good for you good for you
NPCs but I would point out the following it's
possible that the the 25% who were not convicted of a crime um you know may be
all tatted up they might be associating with MS-13 we might know that they're part of a
gang but they haven't been convicted of it so I don't know if the 25% are all
you know your gardener and your you know your your hardworking uh meatacking
employee i I don't know if it's that but I will say that the the one thing that the
Israel Iran war is uh affecting is it's
taking our attention away from other stuff so the Democrats who probably would love
to spend more time talking about the innocent you know good citizens who are
not technically legal residents of the country you know how they're being abused by the the Trump immigration
program but doesn't it feel like it doesn't matter as much
it matters as much as it ever did but in in our minds because this other thing
seems bigger you know like we might get nuked at some point it just seems so much bigger we might put boots on the
ground and yet another pointless war in the Middle East it's just so much bigger
that the whole immigration thing um I think uh Trump's you know border people
are going to get a little bit of a break because the news just isn't going to put much attention on it and what people
care about is what they say in the news if it's not in the news people will stop
protesting so um all the shelf space of the news is
getting used up in other news Fox Business is reporting
that uh Republican Josh Holly is pushing to raise the minimum wage in those
states where it's not already raised so the current federal minimum wage is $7.25
he wants that to go to $15 per hour and Republicans typically have not been
all uh pro raising the uh minimum wage
but Josh Holly would be you know one of the best supporters of President Trump
um he's about as Republican as you could possibly get and he's the one he's the one pushing it so I guess uh Trump's
response when asked about it because you know this is obviously not typical Republican
stuff but it's coming from a real Republican you know pro- MAGA kind of a
guy um Trump says "I haven't seen it i'd have to speak to Josh he's a very good
friend of mine," Trump said and uh that's interesting that Josh did that
you have to think about that one so how about that
how would you like to be so credible that when uh the president hears that
you have an idea that probably his first reflex would be to be against instead of
just reflexively saying "I don't like that idea," he says "Uh that's
interesting that Josh did that you have to think about that one." Now that's
credibility right there that's I if you want to if you ever want to be credible
you want to get to the point where somebody who's reflexed to disagree with you is completely deactivated
because you as an individual are so credible that's that's what's happening
here so this is another example of you know when you think the mega coalition
is is falling apart i think Republicans are way more
uh accepting of of alternate alternative opinions
and this is a good example as long as the person is credible and you know that
they have the best interest in the country in mind then you're willing to listen to it so that sounds like what
Trump is he's just willing to listen to the argument good answer
all right according to MIT uh they've they found the AI can rewrite
its own code and that's changing everything now this is in Geeky Gadgets
uh Julian Horsey is writing about this so it's what they call it the SEAL framework self- adapting language models
so what they're doing is that the the AI will sort of imagine
different scenarios that aren't real and that they would call that synthetic
training data and then it would uh self-edit and update its internal parameters based on the synthetic
training data now what would be another name for synthetic training data
well it would be imagination it would be imagination because it's not based on reality but you perceive it as
if it's reality but you know it's not and I would only add I think that's how
humans work when you're thinking about doing something that you know is not
routine don't you imagine all of the outcomes and when you're imagining all the
different outcomes is that not you using your human brain for what the AI would
call synthetic training data i do i mean is your brain different than
mine if if I'm considering any kind of big move or anything important I imagine
it going right i imagine it going wrong and I imagine all the other
possibilities and each of them are not real they're synthetic
synthetic training data from my own brain and then once I've seen a bunch of
synthetic imaginary possibilities
uh that retrains my brain for whichever one of those I think is the most likely
or the you know the favored one or whichever one scares me the most I want to avoid the most etc but I feel like
this is a a perfect uh a perfect description of what a human brain does
it imagines synthetic data and then it rewrites it rewrites your own brain
based on your imagination that's what TDS is tds is people imagining this you
know authoritarian king and then they rewrite their brains in this case into
mental illness so it's not always good you know AI might have the same problems
um but it seems to me that imagination
if it if it works correctly it helps you make a better decision but if your
imagination is flawed as it is with the authoritarian
Trump stuff he's going to be your king if your imagination is flawed
uh which you might call your synthetic training data then you're going to have mental illness
so I predict that AI will have mental illness
so that's my prediction mental illness and furthermore that the only way to fix
the mental illness if it gives it to itself by creating synthetic training
data and then convincing itself that it's true or acting as though the this
is reality that you're going to need something like an AI therapist
that you would have to there would have to be a separate AI that would work with your AI to help it with its mental
problems because it's imagining ing that a king is going to take over or it's
imagining that you know executive orders are authoritarian or something
so that's coming um according to Breitbart
Bob Price is writing about a sophisticated crossborder tunnel
uh that's been found that links San Diego to Tijuana apparently it's just this massive tunnel they found which
which makes me ask the following questions um has not the Trump administration been
bragging about zero people getting across the border or zero people
released i forget what the exact phrase is but how would we know how many people are
coming through tunnels that we haven't found would we know
um now they were thinking they're thinking that this tunnel is for moving drugs because it had like a a railroad
component to it so it looked like it was for moving large weights
but if it were moving people would we even know i don't know cuz we we didn't
know about this tunnel until recently so I don't know if it was functioning
actually but uh how many tunnels are there there must be a lot of them
there's got to be at least one tunnel for every cartel
well wired wired uh publication and Reese Rogers is talking about Amazon is
um upgrading their ALexa i won't say it out loud because it'll
activate your devices at home but uh the thing that Amazon has that you talk to
um is using a quote staggering amount of AI tools to rewrite it so here's the
advantage of being a slow follower of a trend
if if Amazon had been a fast follower or tried to be like the leading edge of AI
they would have had you know whatever tools you have when you first start which would not be that great but
because it seems like they waited too long it feels like they're at least a year behind AI um they get the advantage
of using all the AI tools to build their AI so apparently they've done a massive
amount of coding using AI to do the coding in the process of building their
own AI that will drive their ALexa so I guess that's being rolled out to
some specific power users but we'll see it pretty soon
uh I just was uh impressed by the fact that when you start
makes such a difference you know being first like IBM was the first with uh you
know Windows computers but they didn't last so being a uh a follower who jumps
in like right at the right time when all the tools are there and you know you really know what you can and cannot do
pretty good approach jeff Bezos team doing it again
well the BBC is reporting that the uh founder and boss of the
Telegram app it's a messaging app uh plans to leave his multi-billion dollar
fortune to over a hundred children he fathered a hundred
now he didn't do it the Elon Musk way he only had um I guess six children you
know the sort of normal way that people have children and all the rest of his
hundredish children were because he had donated to a sperm bank
so he plans to leave his money to children he's never met that he was
the sperm donor for now if you've ever seen this guy he's first of all a genius
and second of all really good-look so you can really imagine why he would
been selected a lot to be the uh the sperm donor but uh I love how
billionaires reproduce um I have to admit that there's
something about this makes sense now I guess he's not going to leave he's not going to leave them the money right away
there's something like a 30-year delay between you know when he makes the money available and and when he dies so he
wants to make sure that they can you know make a life for themselves before they get any of his money but uh yeah
he's the official father of over a 100 babies uh conceived in over 12 countries
wouldn't that be wild to have a hundred babies
there's a uh friend of mine who uh in her adult life learned that she was a um
basically a sperm donor baby and then at the same time learned that
she had uh dozens I think dozens of half
siblings and they started fighting each other how wild would that be to be an adult like
you're in the middle of your life and you learn that you have a like
dozens of half siblings and you start meeting each other that would be so wild
anyway according to the Ohio State University most women want children but
half are unsure if they will well you know how I could make sure that they uh
have children they they should use that billionaire sperm donor and try to get in on that on
the uh inheritance that might help um so apparently a lot
of people have the intention to have a baby but uh they don't necessarily think
that it would make a difference that their happiness wouldn't necessarily be
worse or better if they had a baby or not so clearly unless we plan to
reproduce with robots alone which maybe we will you never know um we're going to
have to completely reconfigure society so that having babies makes sense again
and the only way I can think of that is if people who want to have babies um
find living conditions that are ideal for having a baby
and I would argue that if you're in an inner city not not a great place to have
a baby but if you're also in a very rural area
again maybe not the best place to have a baby um so I'm going to give you my idea
that you're going to fight against if you're an NPC and you're going to say no
small houses even though this has nothing to do with tiny homes you'll say it anyway because that's what NPCs say i
believe that we need to develop a cities that are optimized for having babies
and all that would mean is that you had little neighborhood areas where people
who are having babies around the same time are living so that there's always somebody who can watch your kid um I
think I've told you this before but in my first marriage there was this
extremely lucky situation where the two stepkids
were exactly the same gender and same age as I think four different couples
that we knew really well so on any given weekend
um the kids would have a sleepover at the house of somebody that you knew really well so you trusted them
and the kids would be delighted and then the parents could have a date night if
they wanted and you wouldn't worry too much cuz you were you were such a tight
group of people and the ages and the genders were perfect so that you know
both the boy and the girl had somebody their age
in this other house um and that was amazing it it was it
just made life so much easier um in so many ways now add to that if it were
walking distance to those houses cuz it wasn't in our case but they were you
know in town they weren't that far away so imagine then imagine uh adding the
Tesla auto cab and imagine that you've got one that's so safe that you could
send a a smallalish kid you know not too small but 12 years old let's say um to
their friend's house without having to leave your house now imagine that you had um essentially
free or lowcost child watching stuff while you're working you know if you
designed your if you designed your town so it was optimized so the kids had
friends and you had people to help you do things when you needed a little help
it would be great to have kids you would have you'd have uh parties all the time
and you know there'd be fun sleepovers and you know it would be wonderful it's
just that if you're if you don't have a let's say grandparents around to watch
your kids it's really hard for two people to have a job which we tend to
need these days two people to have a job and also raising kids it's almost I mean
it's so expensive and it's just so hard that you can imagine why people don't do
it but you could design around that you could engineer a living space that you
don't have to live in so the NPCs could say you can't make me live in that
15-minute city no it's not a 15minute city all it is is a great place to raise
a kid that's it that's all it is all right ladies and gentlemen that's
all I got for you today uh hope you have a great weekend i'm going to say a few words privately to the locals people my
beloved locals people and the rest of you hope to see you next week well not
next week we'll see you tomorrow same time same place
