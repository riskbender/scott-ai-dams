hey there you are i was uh just checking on your stocks so
you don't have to they're up a little bit not bad
but let's get our comments working and then we'll have some fun
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if
you'd like to take this experience up to levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a copper a mug or a
glass a tank or shells or sign a canine jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill
it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip it
happens now go
yum extraordinary
all right so according to just the news
uh Ben Weed is reporting that uh
that Musk and Trump have spoken on the phone is that confirmed
in the comments you can tell me if that's really something to happen but if
it's true it's the uh most predictable possible outcome because you knew at
some point they were going to talk you know obviously they had to talk
and you knew that they wouldn't keep it ramped up to you know 10 so they were
going to ramp it down which they have and it looks like they may have agreed to just stop uh insulting each other on
social media so maybe they maybe I don't
know wasn't on the call but maybe uh all they did is decide it wasn't good
to insult each other in public because I I can't imagine a scenario in
which uh Trump said "Look you know let's just pass this bill and you know it
supports conservative stuff you like and and then everything's fine." I feel like
there must be a uh second part of this where maybe Trump said you know we we'll
get to those savings but that's a future step we'll see
well in other news the FDA has approved lab grown salmon
according to popular science so it's a cultivated fish i wonder why they would
choose salmon first maybe it's the most popular i don't know um but the uh FDA
has now green lit the project and if you want to grow your own salmon
well I don't know if you can do it on your own but um there's already one
restaurant that's serving it now doesn't it seem to you
that you wouldn't need that much equipment to grow your own salmon cuz
they they start with some cells and then I think they just uh keep it in some
kind of environment that has right you know PHP and acid and whatever it just
grows it seems to me that uh that wouldn't
take up much space for how much they might produce so you'd
get sick of one one kind of fish but if you could grow multiple fish in a device
that was let's say as big as your maybe your barbecue or you know your oven
um and it could feed your family all the protein you needed
would you build one so that you had one or would it cost as much to uh to make
the fish as you know the fish would cost if you bought it i don't know
i I think this uh might be a maybe not for you but for some people it might let
them live off the grid because I I always thought that was the last thing because we know how to make
water out of the air we know how to make electricity out of the sun and we know
how to store it in a battery so we know how to grow you know lettuce and uh
crappy vegetables in a indoor garden but we didn't know how to make a protein
that somebody would eat probably getting closer
anyway Greta Tunberg um as you know was one of the the
biggest influencers in the uh climate change conversation
and so she uh decided to change her focus recently
and was going to go with a bunch of other people and uh try to talk to
people in Gaza I guess so she was going to be a uh an activist going to Israel
and visiting Gaza and taking some selfies uh but instead of that the IDF
uh detained them and put him on a plane and sent her home
to which I say Greta this wasn't your best work
if all it took was uh the IDF to say "All right you're done get back on this
plane." That's the weakest protest of all time
so in the uh anals anals I don't want to say anals uh of
history this might be uh one of the least effective protests of all time and she's
back on an airplane and should be landing in New Jersey or wherever
um but other news Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg
uh according to Axios is uh creating this uh super intelligence team to work
for him and they'll be building the world's most advanced AI platform
now let me give you the uh the Dilbert filter on that
if you were one of the biggest most important tech companies such as Meta
and you were in the age of AI but you didn't really have much to add
to it you know you you were sort of a follower wouldn't you still feel like you needed
to pretend you were a leader i think you would just for your own
stock price so I remember working at the phone company
and if there was a new technology that would signal that your company was you
know right on the bleeding edge of good stuff we would pay a lot of money to pretend
we were doing something in that space now we didn't say it that way but if you
were near it you knew that you weren't being funded enough or staffed in a way
that you would be influencing this whole technology you would just be sort of
pretending that you were doing something in that space it makes me wonder if if Zuckerberg
really thinks that they're going to you know get the lead on whatever Elon Musk
is doing with AI and whatever uh Chad GBT is doing and whether they think okay
if we get the right staff and we pay enough for the people and we fund them enough and we put enough you know
management attention on it we'll be able to create this you know new AI platform
that's better than anything anybody's ever seen maybe possibly
or it's possible that you just need to demonstrate that you're in that space so your stock
doesn't go down speaking of which Apple is at the uh Worldwide Developers
Conference uh which is where companies like to announce you know upgrades and you know
new features and it doesn't look like they're going to have much to say about AI at all
so do you think Apple stock went up or down
when the investors found out they don't have much to say about AI again
i think it went down now uh that was maybe an hour ago so so you have to keep
an eye on that but my uh Dilbert filter is that if you're not at least
pretending to do a lot with AI you're going to have lower stock
so anyway um we'll see if Zuckerberg can do
it again and come up with a an AI that wows us
well speaking of the uh big beautiful bill
um Speaker Johnson is warning people to warning his own team the Republicans
uh not to get all uh worked up about the salt uh deductions now if you're not in
a state where that matters you don't know what salt uh stands for so it's ST
and it stands for state and local tax uh which is
at least u historically had been a deduction
so if you paid a lot of taxes in your state like California does you would get
to you know deduct that from your federal taxes but um so there's a version of that that
it went away but there's a version of that being put back into this big
beautiful bill with some caps so it's not like it used to be so for example in
my case it would make almost no difference because there's a cap on it
but uh here's what you need to know speaker Johnson wants you to know that
if you mess with salt you're going to get peppered that's right you're going to get
peppered by other politicians who say "Hey stop it we got to get this bill
passed." The other thing uh Trump introduced by the way he seems to be slowing down
on the executive orders which is probably good because I don't know how
you could do that many executive orders as he did in the first 100 days and just
like keep going so we're we're in a little bit in the summer the summer
doldrums so my you know my show won't be as long and the the topics will be artificial
elected the riots we'll talk about that but uh Trump has uh introduced the idea
i guess he signed something that would uh provide a $1,000 per American baby
um and that would be pegged to some index so it's automatically invested
and I assume it would be like the S&P index or something and then it would be open to other people making donations
and the idea would be to make uh children
um investors from day one now it's not necessarily going to teach
those children anything but by the time they reach 18 if especially if their
relatives or their business or something else has uh donated to the accounts it
should be non-trivial you know it's not going to pay for college um but we might
not be going going to college by then it might pay for
um virtual college you know I think a lot of the college will be online and uh
so it might pay for that so I like the idea
um I might just add $1,000 and then maybe another $1,000 of Bitcoin
what do you think would be better for a baby born today $1,000 US
or $1,000 worth of Bitcoin
well I'll tell you which way I'm going to go i would definitely go with the Bitcoin
now now the Bitcoin could be worth nothing in 18 years you know because who
knows quantum computing might you know make it too hard to to hide your stuff i
don't know so there might be something coming that makes Bitcoin worth nothing
but if I had to bet you know $1,000 of Bitcoin today
that's more likely going to pay for your entire college than if you put in $1,000 anyway
um let's check in with the word play of our favorite uh people we're watching
the Democrats so here's a uh here's a post from Bernie
Sanders he says uh Dr king defeated racist government officials and ended
segregation through discipline nonviolent resistance
but he goes on he says "Defeating Trumpism oligarchy and authoritarianism
requires that same level of discipline." Uh then he points out that violent
protests are counterproductive and play right into Trump's playbook so Bernie is
completely aware that the current situation is highly uh beneficial to
Trump's reputation and not the Democrats so I always have to give Bernie some
credit as you know crazy and useless as he is sometimes
um he does at least tell the truth when other Democrats are having trouble doing
it and he this would be one of those times yes this is very good for Trump
it's very bad for the people who are trying to make a point on the street and
we'll talk about that because you know it it doesn't matter till the last
inning who's ahead but here's what uh caught my attention in Bernie Sanders uh
post he started out with oligarchy
so AOC and Bernie were going to go fight the oligarchy and I thought that was
funny because nobody knows what the oligarchy is but now he's a priest now
we've got Trumpism oligarchy and authoritarianism
and you're going to need discipline to defeat them what kind of discipline are you going to
need to defeat them and how many people could define them if you were to stop a
Democrat on the street and say "Can you define Trumpism?"
What exactly would they say i think they might say "Oh Trumpism is
authoritarianism and oligarchy." And then you'd say "All right well what
is oligarchy?" And somebody would say "Well oligarchy is you know when you put Trumpism and
authoritarianism together." Well what is authoritarianism well it's like Trumpism plus oligarchy
all it is is this big circular word soup where they've got words but none of them
seem to carry any real meaning or policy or uh ideas or preferences or or
anything they're just these big words so
at least I got that going for him so Bernie Sanders wants you to worry about
Trumpism oligarchyism no just oligarchy and authoritarianism
those will really get you going won't they
if somebody came to your house and said "Hey join me in the streets uh we're
going to be protesting the uh Trumpism oligarchy and authoritarianism
would would that get you going would you be all "Yes finally somebody's going to protest the
things I care about the most you know not feeding my family or being safe from
crime but Trumpism." And then uh Nancy Pelosi weighed in so
she's uh got her own little word play here um and she says the Trump
administration's escalation and provocation in California
inflames tension and incites violence now the president of the United States
said he would arrest a sitting American governor just for disagreeing with these
actions okay that obviously that didn't happen not with not not the just for
disagreeing part um this is a hallmark of authoritarianism on the road to
tyranny and all Americans should be shocked and appalled by the president's blatant
disregard for our constitutional system so again it's just words
so it's a hallmark of authoritarianism on the road to tyranny
so somebody knocks on your door and says "We got a big problem in this
country we've got the we've got the hallmarks of authoritarianism
on the road to tyranny." Really that sounds terrible what are
they doing exactly well well uh they're
sending in the military to reduce the odds uh that will uh lose property that
belongs to the public and uh reduce the odds of violence
but uh you said there was a hallmark of authoritarianism well that that is that is they're
they're also threatening to arrest the governor who is begging to be arrested
except when Trump says that he's kind of smiling
so how many of you saw what Trump actually said his actual words because
he didn't really say he wants to arrest Gavin Newsome he was kind of joking
about it um we'll get to that anyway um so words
you got your ter tyranny and your authoritarianism so that'll that'll get your blood
running um and then uh
then of course the Democrats have uh this one play that they use for everything it's just one play they sue
so Nuome and California are suing the Trump administration for deploying the
National Guard to Los Angeles now let me ask you this
if you were a property property owner or a business owner of any of those
businesses that are where the protests are happening do you think you'd want
the National Guard there a little bit i think you would i think
you would yeah so the the suing is over some kind of a process question that the
uh I don't know the governor should have been informed or should have signed off on it or something like that but if you
were to if you were just to ask the public do you want the National Guard to
be there just to make sure things don't get out of control on you know there were people lighting cars on fire and
throwing rocks from overpasses onto cars uh do you want more of that or do you
want some National Guard to you know make sure there's a at least a military
well let's say law enforcement in this case presence
i think u most people would agree with Trump wouldn't they
so let's look at uh All right just one more thing
um I saw the uh video on the Maze account
on X and it's a 2007 video of Joe Biden
before his brain was totally fried uh you should watch a old video of Biden
you know under today's uh understanding of how bad it got he used to be a
fasttalking reasonably smart guy so here's something
he said uh in 2007 he was asked if he were president would he allow sanctuary
cities to exist this is 2007 his answer was no he said that sanctuary cities
turned into dumps and the only reason they exist is because the federal government doesn't enforce the law
so in other words Biden was exactly where Trump is basically and uh that's
back when his brain was working it's really the sort of thing that tells you that whatever did happen with Biden
later he wasn't running anything there's just no way that the same Biden from 2007 was
the open border Biden sanctuary cities are great i mean something happened to
him that was just terrible anyway so from a persuasion perspective the LA
riots are um pretty much everything Trump would want
it's the gift that keeps on giving the the Democrats just haven't figured out how any of this
works it it's like they they just keep doing things that are the dumbest thing you
could possibly do in that situation so first of all um I think all the polls
show that the public by majority supports what Trump wants to do for
immigration so they're working against the majority
next the law apparently is on Trump's side on this one now the lawsuit thing
had to do with some technicality but in terms of the law Trump has the legal
right under certain circumstances that seem to have been met to uh add some
military and take control of the uh uh the National Guard for exactly this sort
of situation so he's got the law on his side he's got the public on his side and
then um if I if I ever taught you well I guess
everybody who's read my book Win Bigly knows this but if I were to ask you what
are the two most powerful methods of persuasion
would you know the answer the top two methods of persuasion now it's kind of a
trick question because you know it's there's a little bit more to it but the
top two are fear fear and visual persuasion
so if you want to persuade somebody of anything if you could say if you don't
do this or you do this um you'll all die if you can scare somebody
that is really good persuasion so look at the uh all the recurring video of the
riots what does the news want to show you well
the news wants to show you whatever's spectacular and you know uh flaming and
dangerous and whatever so the news is going to loop all the dangerous stuff so
that picture of the uh the one young man holding the Mexican flag while standing
on a burning American car how many times have you seen that so far a lot right
now that's a really scary image because you think to yourself uhoh there's
people here willing to burn things and you know create some degree of violence
and at least some of them are waving a flag from a country that's not yours
now how scary is that like even if you've rationalized it as a you know as
a let's say a jaded viewer of the news and you just said to yourself ah this
will pass you know it's not going to last forever there's something that just
sort of reaches your animal core when you see somebody burning
burning stuff that belongs to your government or your country and they're waving a flag of another country so the
fear persuasion is pretty high just naturally baked into the situation so
that uh works um really well for Trump's perspective and then as I said the
visual persuasion uh is always at the top of the list so
if you were trying to influence somebody with sound you know just words it
wouldn't work nearly as well as you know the right kind of pictures and these are
definitely the right kind of pictures uh if you're Trump so you got the two strongest forms of
persuasion working in Trump's favor to make the
sanctuary cities look like they're dangerous and chaotic which would make
you want to not have a sanctuary city or not want to live in one and uh it's
going to be endless it's just going to be loop after loop of loop of these
scary visuals yeah there's the uh gentleman on the motorcycle with the
Mexican flag so that's all working for Trump so
Trump's got the American public on his side he's got the law on
his side and he's got the two strongest forms of persuasion
that just sort of naturally exist you know it's not like anything he did that
are very much in his favor um it also keeps the topic of
immigration in the news which is uh probably the one topic where Trump
consistently is in the majority so if you were the Democrats would you
want to keep the topic of immigration as the number one news item all summer
that would be the worst thing you could do because that topic is not in your favor but that's what's happening so
he's got the So Trump has the news cycle in his favor um it also gives Trump a opportunity
to show his main theme which is you're not going to need any violence if you
have a strength so he comes in hard and fast with lots
of strength the National Guard and I guess submarines are being um
operationalized and will it work well it will but
there's a risk right the risk is that somebody gets carried away and you know
one of the military people with a scary rifle ends up shooting someone and it
won't matter what the circumstances are it won't matter how guilty that person is it will only matter that it happens
or it doesn't happen now so far it would appear that the uh National Guard and
the military don't have any kind of orders to shoot anybody for anything so
we don't know what the actual orders are but if it does have the effect which is
most likely it could go it might go the other way but most likely
you're going to see that uh strength and fast action
are effective and that's what Trump would like you to know about dealing with crime dealing
with the border dealing with Ukraine dealing with China
it's always the same thing it's like let's have overwhelming power and then
nobody needs to get hurt so that's working in his favor
um and then the images of the Mexican flags
and uh the people standing on the burning cars i don't think that could
possibly be better for Trump than anything I could think of
it it's the flag that really just sends it into the next level of you know anti-persuasion
so there's that so there you go so Trump has working in his favor the majority of
the American people the laws on his side um he's making Newsome and and Bass look
like idiots because they can't stop this on their own he's making the sanctuary
cities look bad he's not doing anything to make it look bad it's just the
situation does that he's showing uh he's keeping immigration in the news which is
good for him he's got the strongest forms of persuasion working in his side
and uh he's demonstrating his you know key principle of overwhelming strength
to avoid violence how does this get better
no honestly I I saw was it Bernie or somebody said
that uh the the high ground Oh no it wasn't him we we'll get to him
so let me get to that in its normal way
all right so uh 700 Marines deployed and
we might get up to 5,000 troops there would be a combination of mostly
uh mostly National Guard but some of these Marines as well
all right so we got that going for us so there was a big uh back and forth
between Gavin Newsome and Trump on this question of uh arresting him now Gavin
being the theater kid that he is wanted to make a big deal then of you want to
arrest these people you arrest me come arrest me you know so he was trying to
be the hero now it doesn't really work on him because there's something so you
know non genuine about anything he does that it's
really hard to believe that you know he would really want uh take the punishment for somebody else or
you know arrest me first but we do assume that he would love the visual of
it because it would look like authoritarianism and then they could use those videos forever so it doesn't make
sense for Tom Holman to arrest Nuome and
remember Nuome was originally talking to Tom Holman so he wasn't talking to Trump
when he said arrest me and uh Tom Baldwin I think has been consistent
which is that it wouldn't matter who it is if somebody is breaking the law
uh which would include preventing them from doing their job that there might be a case where somebody might get arrested
and it could be a governor so it's it's just sort of sitting out there as a
threat and something to talk about i I don't think it's doesn't seem very
likely it's going to happen but uh so Trump was asked should Tom
Hullman arrest Nuome now remember they're not asking if Trump
would do it as president you know order it uh they asked if Tom Holman should do
it which suggests to me uh without saying it should he do it if
the situation called for it not just for fun
yeah but if the situation clearly called for it and Nuome was clearly violating
some law then would it make sense for Tom Holman to make his own decision about arresting
him anyway Trump said uh I would do it if I were Tom
now I always tell you that Trump always finds the most provocative thing to say
so that you can't forget anything he ever says well the most provocative
thing he could say is I would do it if I were Tom what he's not saying is that he
would order it as president or that you know he would do it as president he's just saying if I were in
that job and he obstructed my you know my legal authority to do this work I
might arrest him now I think the reality is the odds of them
arresting a sitting governor especially this one who likes the publicity pretty
low but but I I do kind of like the fact that he puts it out there
like he he's not taking it off the table but I also don't take it seriously so if
you're a a very casual watcher of the news you might take it seriously but if
you're let's say a news junkie like most of you are
how many of you take that seriously that Governor Nuome might get arrested
i mean you could imagine it if he you know really ran down and uh started
pushing ICE officers out of the way to you know to rescue some somebody who was
being arrested you could imagine it but really
I mean not really it's not even a real thing so it's sort of summer news
summer news is someone might arrest uh the governor of California
real news nobody's going to arrest the governor of California
unless he really really tried hard to get arrested and that would just look different
um but then uh Trump says after Trump says "I would do it if I were Tom," he says
"Gavin likes the publicity but he's done a terrible job." So the fact that Trump knowingly says
that uh Gavin would like the publicity it means they're all operating with the
same understanding of what this really is it's not really a law enforcement question it's not it's not even a
serious hypothetical really it's just something to talk about in the
summer anyway so then Gavin Newsome decides to
you know leap on what Trump says he says "The president of the United States just
called for the arrest of a sitting governor." No he didn't
he was asked what he would do if he were in a different job
he he did not call for the arrest of a sitting governor that would look very different and you would know it if he
did it so Gavin starts out with a lie that's
close enough to the topic in question that people aren't going to you know maybe even notice as a lie so they're
going to say "Wow the president of the United States called for the arrest of a sitting governor."
Not really but uh he goes on "Uh this is a day I hoped I would never see in
America." Now we're going to see some theatrical drama you ready i don't care if you're a
Democrat or Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation this is an
unmistakable step toward Guess what authoritarianism
that's right authoritarianism so apparently the new word of the day is
authoritarianism pelosi is using it and Bernie's using it
and now Newsome is using it and I guess their idea is that if they show a bunch
of you know armed people in the city that uh at least maybe Democrats will
say "Well look at those armed people in the city that are being ordered there by
Trump only an authoritarianism." Oh no only an a
somebody interested in authoritarianism would do such a thing
but how much of the country do you think thinks that way especially after living
through the Floyd riots and the BLM and the Antifa and even the the Tesla
um burnings i feel like most of us would like to see more law enforcement
as long as they're in the right place doing the right stuff which apparently they are it's not it's not like he
randomly put the military into Detroit or something you know there was there was a specific
you know risk of violence and there was a known way to handle it which is put in
enough law enforcement and so Trump did that i don't think that's going to work
in Nome's favor and then uh JD Vance weighed in
and posted at uh on Axe at Newslam he
said uh do your job that's all we're asking
do your job that's all we're asking now that made me wonder the following do you
think JD Vance needs to get permission from Trump's uh
team before he does a post like that
because when he says do your job that's all we're asking he's basically
downplaying the we're going to arrest you thing you know as if that were never serious in the first place just do your
job like we're we're not asking anything extraordinary just you know do your job so that's a
pretty good post but don't you wonder if JT has the trust of the administration
to do that specific kind of a post or does he have to run it by somebody
i would say I don't know but I'm going to make a guess
and my guess is that JT has proven himself to the point where he does not
need to run that by anybody because he is such a good communicator
and he understands perfectly what the president intends and he understands the
base perfectly so this was a good post
um because it you know took it out of that we'll arrest you mode and took it down to just do your job so then Gavin
Newsome falls into the trap and uh he goes with the job theme so he
responds back to JD Vance he says "Do your job we didn't have a problem until
Trump got involved resin the order return control to California now resend
the order I think means the uh the National Guard order
so so JD Vance effectively
changed the conversation from arresting a governor to are you doing your job or
not and then Nome fell into the trap of instead of saying "No no the real issue
is somebody trying to arrest the governor for no reason," he just went with the job thing and just said you
know about your job do your job do you think that many Americans believe that
Trump is a reason that the protests are getting out of hand
well maybe if they have just a very pro-sanctuary city you know idea it kind
of makes sense but I don't think most people are going to think that are they
it It doesn't really look like National Guard causes riots
don't you think riots cause the National Guard to show up or or there are people
in the United States who are actually thinking you know what if that if that
darn Trump deploys the National Guard riots are going to break out
does anybody think that backwards now I realize it's just team play so
there's going to be plenty of people who you know come up with a tortured
explanation of why Trump is the cause of sanctuary city riots because he's you
know trying too hard with uh immigration enforcement etc well anyway so uh
Senator John Fedterman posted this he said uh I unapologetically stand for
free speech peaceful demonstrations and immigration but that is uh but this is
not that he said this is anarchy and true chaos
so it kind of looks like he's blaming his own side for anarchy and true chaos
and then he says "My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to
condemn setting cars on fire destroying buildings and assaulting law enforcement."
So there he is again u Fedman finds that
kind of common sensical you know American middle but I think he missed
the moral high ground he's saying the moral high ground would be to condemn
the setting of fire of cars and the violence and stuff like that now I think that would be a good thing to happen i
would love to see the Democrats condemn all the forms of violence
but it's not the highest high moral high ground
the higher moral high ground is you need to get your team to stop funding and organizing riots
you You're not You can You're not going to convince me that the real problem is
that you're observers the Democrats are not observers
they're members of a large political party whose allies almost certainly are
behind all of this now I'm not saying the Democratic Partyy's behind it but
their allies are i mean pretty obviously and clearly and yeah so the uh the high
moral high the moral high ground is to stop funding it
yeah if you don't fund it it's probably not going to happen because I I like to say again how many of the people who
were you know at the protests um were thinking to themselves even two
months ago you know the most important thing I could do is risk my freedom and
my health to protest sanctuary cities being uh being violated
probably very few very a few you know not zero
but very very few so this could not be more artificial
and for Democrats to pretend that it's just sort of breaking down on its own
it's not we're we're we're watching this as
wise seasoned observers of the news and we knew this would happen what a year
ago we can predict every summer we'll have a new fake Democrat protest here it is
um and then Byron York points out in a
post on Acts at the bottom of the riots in California it says city and state
officials there want to have their own immigration law and they can't have
their own immigration law so again this is you know the law being on Trump's side
you can't really have the states deciding their own immigration laws
because imagine that would imagine if that's the law then it wouldn't matter
if the federal government said things were illegal you can't come across the
border as long as uh let's say California said "Yeah come on in borders open no problem
those those cannot coexist so somebody some one entity
needs to be in control of immigration because you just can't you can't parse
that out you know as soon as you say you do what you want and I do what I want somebody's
going to have a big open border and then another state is going to be all right
we're going to try to stop everybody coming into our state but it won't make any difference because people will just
come in through the open port so there really isn't any situation
in which anybody but the feds are in control of immigration nothing else would work
all right um I saw pictures of an Apple store getting looted
in downtown LA and I wondered if any of you have the same feeling
when I watch a crime happen um I generally feel revulsion you know
like oh god you know these these darn criminals and they should be caught and
go to jail and you know why didn't that retailer build a booby trap or you know
so I'm always saying the worst worst case scenario but for some reason whenever I see an Apple store being
looted cuz you know it's happened quite a few times now i always think if you
were a looter that would be the most fun to loot
if you ever watched the looters do a Apple store and they just go down the line grabbing each phone and you ripping
it off its little uh little cable and it always like every every handful is like
$1,000 it's like every phone they rip out and take with them is like $1,000
but then I also wonder does Apple not track every one of those phones
and can law enforcement not if they wanted to i mean it probably wouldn't be worth
the effort could they not hunt down every one of those fake F well every one
of those stolen phones could Apple not send a code to each of those phones that
just locks them up so they can't sell them i got lots of questions about Apple but
uh I'm uh I'm not proud to admit that when I watch the Lutters rob the Apple
store I think to myself huh if I were a looter that looks like a lot of fun
i'm not encouraging it do not loot an Apple store but if you've paid for as
many Apple phones as I have uh you you feel like Apple has been
robbing you for years i'm just saying I don't recommend
robbing i'm not in favor of it at all but when I watch the lutters take down
an Apple store doesn't feel the same as when I when they're knocking off like a
little grocery store or something like that that really bothers me
well Robert RFK Jr has ousted uh every
member of the advisory committee on immunizations practices so apparently
there was an advisory committee that decided or at least recommended
uh when vaccines were necessary and when they should be used and uh so now RFK Jr has got rid of
every one of them it makes you wonder what was it about every one of them that
made them so replaceable was it that they didn't use science
or that they thought they did use science now I could see why you'd want to change
them out even if you were putting equally qualified people uh to backfill
because once people have made a certain decision uh they're very unlikely to say "Oh your
new argument changes my mind and I guess I was wrong to recommend these vaccines
for children or whatever." So it does make sense if you're looking to make
potentially and you you don't even know for sure but if you're potentially
trying to make a big change such as you know changing the vaccine
recommendations you might have to get rid of all the people who have sort of settled into a
point of view because I I think they would be less likely to you know really
take any new information and incorporate it now that's just a statement about
people in general it's not a it's not a statement about any of these individuals
but in general sometimes you just need a clean sweep as I think Trump called it
well let's check on some of the dumbest um Democrats
uh Whoopi Goldberg she believes the Trump Musk feud was fake
uh and she said on her show "I love that y'all bought into it the Trump Musk
feud." And then Alyssa Fer Griffin said "Oh it's not fake it's not fake." Whoopy
said "I do believe it's fake." Uh she said "Uh yes I do it's too
strategic." Now how many of you as of today
how many of you think that was a fake disagreement
and what fake disagreement involves all right here's the deal you call me a
pedophile and I'll say you have mental health problems
in what world do people make that agreement
i mean seriously I I I understand the general idea that sometimes things are
not what they seem and sometimes people fake a you maybe fake a feud to get some
attention so you know it's not like those things don't happen but in the history of fake feuds
has anybody ever said "I'll call you a pedophile and you you you say that I
have mental health problems?" I don't think so or or drug problems
even worse so no Whoopi i think we're well past
was it fake or was it real it was real and then Hakeim Jeff
speaking of dumb Democrats um he he's still going after the masking of
the ICE agents and he actually said this in public he said "If they are proud of
what they're doing meaning the masked ICE agents if they're proud of what
they're doing why are they masked he goes "This isn't the 30s why are they
masked?" To which I ask why would you ask such a stupid question
is there even one person who is listening to this who doesn't know why they're masked
it's not because they're embarrassed of what they're doing i like for a moment I thought "Oh I
should you know explain to my audience why they're masked." And then I thought
to myself "Oh wait a minute there there aren't any freaking idiots in my
audience." Like you are all smart enough to turn on a digital device and uh
navigate to a show and then listen to it no every single one of you know why they
need to wear masks there's no mystery here whatsoever i don't need to explain it but Hakee Jeff he doesn't understand
so Whoopi thinks that the Trump Musk thing was staged and Hakee Jeff can't
understand why people who would be at risk would want to cover their
identities now I assume he really does know
but he thinks the other Democrats won't
what kind of weird game would he be playing uh I think you would be playing the stupid one all right so Microsoft
has this big conference every year called the Build Conference and I guess
they used to do it in um Seattle but now the uh according to the postm millennial
uh they've decided not to have them in Seattle anymore because Seattle has
turned into a cesspool of homeless people and
dirt and crime and whatever else so Seattle lost one of its uh high-profile
events um and the issues cited were uh rampant
homelessness visible drug use and urban decay
so just in case Seattle was wondering huh what is the difference between
managing the city well and just letting it run on its own well apparently you
lose the Microsoft money so that's not ideal
um there's some uh new good news
on the economy so almost all of the US job growth under Trump is in the private
sector whereas 25% of that was under under Biden 25% of it was in the
government jobs now I was wondering how exactly
did Biden andor Trump determine where those jobs would be
you know I guess I can see why the government would not be adding as much under Trump
but uh it's good news either way and then uh let me read just a summary
from White House press secretary Caroline Levit
um so the economy is booming she says jobs are up unemployment is down wages
are increasing and inflation is dead more than 139,000 good jobs were added
to the private sector all accounted for by Americanborn workers
is all that true um I believe it is true i believe that
uh individual wages are up a little bit inflation seems to be
you know under control relative to what it had been uh jobs are up
unemployment's down everything's good except for
except for what the debt every time I hear anybody talking about
the economy if they don't mention the national debt
you're not even talking about the economy we'd better find a way to handle that
debt so the real question will be this did anything that the uh little squabble
between Musk and Trump um that they had did any of that lead to anything good
um it wouldn't it wouldn't express itself yet but if in the subsequent
uh budget packages that are upcoming if it turns out that we do make some big
cuts and maybe even ones that people didn't expect that might suggest
that Musk you know made a dent and that Trump knew that having him on his side
was better than not so we'll see
um the I don't know what it would take to make uh Elon Musk you know not
comment on this topic for however long but I don't know that he would do it
unless he had some kind of asurances that you and I don't know about
and I don't think he would do it for asurances about you know EV credits or
asurances about SpaceX or anything although those would obviously matter to
him i think it would have to be asurances that they would take more
seriously the the budget cuts in this upcoming process
so we'll see if that's the case all right who's the debt owed to a lot
of it is owed to Dan all right ladies and gentlemen that's all I've got for today i'm going to talk to the uh folks
on Locals Privately uh hope you enjoyed the show and uh
we'll see you again tomorrow morning same time same place and uh we'll see
some more uh some more persuasion lessons tomorrow
accidental ones all right uh coming at you privately locals and the rest of you
i hope to see you tomorrow thanks for joining
