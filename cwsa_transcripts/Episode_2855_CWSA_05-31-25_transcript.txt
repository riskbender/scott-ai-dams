there you are let's get the comments going and then we got a
show all right everything's working today that's what I like to
see that's what I like to see
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody can even understand with your tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a copper mug or glass a tanker gels a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any kind fill it with
your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparallel pleasure
the dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called the simultaneous sip and happens now
go if it seems to you that I'm slurring my words
uh you would not be hallucinating there's something wrong with this side of my mouth that I can't
quite use it so maybe I have to talk out of the other side of my mouth no I'll
just talk out of this side the side of my mouth's pretty good all right we'll see what happens so after the uh show
today Owen Gregorian will be hosting a spaces that's the audio only feature
within X so you can find that by going to Owen Gregorian's page or you could
look for my page Scott Adams says and you'll see it near the top so about a
few minutes after the show um Owen will fire that up um as some of
you know um and the only reason I'm telling you this is because she's been
part of the show my loyal dog Snickers has gone to the big forum in the sky um
and you might wonder if that's why I missed the show yesterday and the answer is no actually um I was in extraordinary
pain for the last two days like I've never even felt that much pain it went
away today no particular reason didn't do anything different but I woke up and
that pain was gone so I got to experience the the end of my dog's life
with the most pain I've ever felt in my life so to say that the last two days were not
ideal that would be an understatement they were not ideal so uh let's uh let's get past that
and talk about the news uh according to
SWBS University whoever they are practicing kindness reduces loneliness
and increases cooperation now can you believe it that when you're
nice to people they'd rather spend time with you and also they'd be more
cooperative because you're nice um is there any way they could have
saved some money on that study yes next time just ask Scott i'm pretty sure I
could have told you that being nice has a rather wide range of benefits
will it help you at work yes will it help you with your social life yes will
it help you in every way that you can imagine yes be nice be
nice all right well according to the University of
Michigan uh researchers are trying to figure out how to uh use the same kind
of persuasion that the tobacco that was used against the tobacco industry to get
people to uh not smoke but in this case they'd be trying to get people to not eat junk
food and here's the interesting part that you
would imagine that the most effective way to get people not to do something that's bad for them would be to say "Hey
that's bad for you don't do that." Turns out that's not the case um and uh what
they found was that focusing on industry tactics rather than individual choices
they could change perceptions in other words people are willing to hurt
themselves if it's their choice so if you say eating this uh this
this fast food could make you fat and blah blah blah people will say "Yeah
maybe it could but I really like this food." But if you say to them "People you don't
know are screwing you with their with their clever addictive treatments and
they're basically taking your money and killing you." Well then it feels
personal it doesn't feel like you're making the choice it feels like something that somebody's doing to
you and apparently that's more persuasive so keep that in your
persuasion bag of tricks that people care more about being manipulated than they care about even
their own health that's that's a good one to know well according to interesting
engineering um Japan did a little did a little test
and they moved uh a million gigabits per second over special kind of uh
fiber now you might say to yourself isn't fiber already fast enough
do we really need it to be that fast and the answer is yes because in the AI
world um there's going to be a whole lot of lot of video and a lot of AI and
probably so it it also made me wonder if people are going to have to move to
places where they have this kind of super internet i mean it's going to take a while for this specific one to work
its way into the market but if you're a developer and you're working from home
and you're doing AI stuff how long will it be before you realize that your
connection at home just will never get the job done and you're going to have to
go into the office and you know get onto their super super cable i don't know
we'll see but one of the things I never think about with AI is I don't think about the
transmission speed but that's a gaining factor you know not just how many
servers you have but uh can you move it back and forth well Jake Tapper's CNN
show hit its lowest rating since 2015 according to Fox News who loves to
report on that so he had his lowest rated month in nearly a decade in May at
the same time he was out there uh promoting his book which is doing very well by the way his book is a big
hit um by comparison uh Fox News uh the five and then special
report with Brett Bearer that runs at the same time as Tapper uh average way
more people you don't need to know the numbers but they just absolutely
trounced him what do we learn from this well according to the ratings mocking
Jake Tapper on the five is more popular than listening to him on his own
show if you turn on the five at about the same time that Tapper is on that the
five is going to be mocking him for you know any various things it's just more
popular they mock better than he does news here's a interesting little factoid
from Stanford University so they were testing a little uh program well program not a not a
computer program but a system for teaching people financial concepts
easily and what they found was that uh a real good way to do it is in twominut
stories about the real world and I've tried to teach people
various you know personal financial things over the years and it's hard so
if you just describe you know what a stock is and how to buy it and stuff
people kind of glaze over but if you told a story well you know Bob didn't
want to buy this stock but I talked him into buying Apple 10 years ago and then he made a bunch of money then
automatically you would say "Oh okay i get that story i better learn how to do
stocks." And then you would do a little bit of your own work to figure out what's going on so
um the first thing I'd say about this is this this is one of the examples of
systemic racism but also systemic poorism now I grew up in a family where
my father was an active stock trader now he wasn't very good at it and
he had a he had a what do you call it a broker you which was probably ripping
him off the entire time i don't know but the result of that was that he was
always telling little stories so when I was little I was hear about stocks and buying stocks and
things like that so by the time I was an adult I wasn't afraid of it like I knew
enough to figure out how to do it and how to open up an account and what it
was all about and you know I had a degree by then economics so the the economics degree didn't teach
me anything about stocks but just the fact that I was exposed to it when I was
young definitely made a difference and made me a little bit financially wiser
so I do think that's one of those situations that um is a systemic advantage to people
whose parents know a little bit about finance anyway um so the the thing that
I would find the most useful as a story would be anybody who has the same
situation as I do and then they did something about it so if somebody has a
401k at work and you find out they fully funded it and you're in the same company
or you have a 401k you say "Huh Bob fully funded his 401k i don't even know
what a 401k is but I better figure it out so little stories about what somebody did is
enough to get somebody to research that thing and and become somewhat uh
self-taught just by exposure it's a real good idea well uh Trump was asked I guess it
was yesterday if he would consider a a pardon for Denny
now Trump has a habit of never answering a question the way you think he
should but whatever he's doing is working so I'm not going to complain about it so who in the world would act
like they're open to pardoning Diddy at this point only only Trump because I
guess I used to get along until Trump got into politics and he said
uh um that uh nobody's asked but if I
think somebody was mistreated so basically he was saying I don't know anything about the details of the story
but I won't rule it out only Trump would say that this is
the most provocative thing you could possibly say but
Okay um I guess uh Trump won another legal
battle so I never understood why he was suing the Pulitzer Prize
people um well actually his lawsuit is against the New York Times and the Washington
Post um Oh no but the case is against the Pulitzer board now the reason that
he's suing them is that they gave a pulisser for the fake the the the
writers who did the fake uh Russia collusion stories and because they have not been
withdrawn now that we know that was all fake it kind of makes it look like maybe
Trump was guilty because somebody won a Puliter Prize for saying he was so it uh it gets into the realm of
defamation simply because they haven't withdrawn the award which is actually a pretty good
argument it's a pretty good argument i don't know if it'll pass legal muster
but it did get past uh current challenge to proceed so the lawsuit will proceed
we'll see if he wins i think he's got a case according to
uh Cash Patel uh when Comey did his sea shell thing
where he said 8647 uh it caused a whole bunch of
copycats to do the same messaging online which caused the FBI to have to do a
whole bunch of investigations because they can't really ignore any threat to the president
so that's the that's the worst thing that I think came out of it is all the
copycats now some of those copycats might be thinking that it's
something to act on as opposed to just message on so that turned into just a
horrible situation all the way around so fewer FBI handling things like crimes
you'd like to solve and more of them trying to solve sea shell related Comey
problems that's not good um according to uh Tulsi Gabbard who was
on the Will Kaine show on Fox um she's going to declassify or she did
declassify reports exposing how the Biden administration used intelligence
agencies to target Americans who had dissenting views on COVID immigration
and the 2020 election labeling them domestic violent extremists
now you know what's missing from this story where's the list am I on
it yeah it It's weird to be a citizen of the United States and to not know if
you're on a list of violent domestic extremists yes or no i'd like to know
that i feel like I'd like to know that so I don't know if this is a new
story it feels like a repeat but anyway um if you haven't already heard it
journalist Glenn Greenwald is having what the Daily News is calling a
scandal a scandal that's their opinion i There's no scandal as far as I can tell
but somebody released some sex videos of Glenn Greenwald and some consenting
partner so nothing illegal is alleged um but I like the fact that uh
Greenwall just says essentially "Yes that was me." And he says he's not
embarrassed and it was uh two consenting adults and and we're done here and I
thought to myself aren't we way past the point
where somebody being exposed for having gay sex would have any impact whatsoever
on their career it feels like it wouldn't have any impact at all
but and we also don't know the source but he but he he says he's getting close
to finding out who released it um but in a related story or maybe it's
not you you be the judge according to the Daily Wire support for gay marriage has
plummeted among Republicans in a Gallup poll so do you think that somebody was
um devious enough to know that support for gay marriage had plummeted among
Republicans and Greenwald is at the moment more popular with Republicans so
was this a way to spoil him for his main audience of
Republicans and would it work because I had no idea that the uh support for gay
marriage was way down among Republicans and I ask you is that because of the trans issues i I feel
like trans and gay got conflated and you could argue whether
they should have or or shouldn't have but I feel like the the bad feeling
about trans especially in sports and especially how much attention they were getting may have just sort of had a
spillover effect for Republicans um on just ordinary gay people who are
minding their own business so these two stories are kind of um
disturbing when you see them together it's disturbing that Republicans have had such a shift in opinion about gay
marriage what bad thing happened because of gay
marriage i'm not aware of anything that went wrong because gays were getting
married did something happen I don't know about it has to be the trans stuff right what else could it be but uh
perhaps somebody was taking advantage of that shift in attitudes to take a shot
at Glenn Greenwald and I expect it's somebody who doesn't like his political
opinions we'll find out but the way he's handling it I always say that a lack of
embarrassment is a superpower well you're definitely seeing the superpower now so and most of us are
never going to see the the videos there it's not like they're on regular internet you know you're not going to
see them on X or Instagram or anything so you'll never see them most of you
unless you go looking for them which I don't
recommend maybe just leave them alone you know um here's a little bit
about Harvard endowments so you've heard that Harvard has $50 billion in
endowments and everybody says you don't need any government money why don't you
spend your endowments and but most of you know that at least by now that 80%
of those endowments are limited for specific uses it's not like a big bank
account so it's stuff like this is for the athletic teams and this one's to
build this building and put my family name on it so only 20% of it is even in
play um but it's worse than that because there's some kind of rule that says
universities [Music] um they can only spend like 5% of it or
something so there's there's a couple of rules that they have internally that kind of limit how they
can even spend any of that money on their their regular operations and then some of it's a grab
bag of smaller donations so they'd have to figure out who's got what restrictions on what so they might be
able to squeeze a little bit out of there but if you're looking at the 50 billion it's probably closer to 1
billion and maybe not even that so if you're saying how much could they spend on
operations if they really tried maybe 1 billion and how much is Trump taking
away from them like three or nine billion or something like that so they
do have a problem the and the and the endowments are not going to help them
except a little bit well Trump is uh was bragging at his uh
recent pressor that he used the trade to stop
the Pakistan and Indian war now we don't know what that means exactly but instead
of threatening somebody with if you do this we'll take a side and bomb you or
we'll do something else to you apparently he either gave them a carrot
or a stick maybe both and said "If you want to be trading with the United States and our
allies here I'm just speculating um you can't you can't be at
war you you're going to have to calm down a little bit and then you can have a normal trading relationship with the
United States and the rest of the world." So I don't know exactly what Trump said maybe it was more threatening
than that but something like that and he's reminding us of that
i like it i do think we want to the the only
way we could end war in a serious way is if everybody got financially
entangled to the point where you just couldn't do it and we're almost there but instead of
letting Russia get financially entangled we did the opposite so they're creating
their own system so yeah it might be the worst case scenario we'll see meanwhile
over in China um they've got a problem because there's
a number of companies that are trying to make the cheapest car they can make and
one of them called the uh I guess by the company BYD they're making a Seagull EV
and that with subsidies it would only cost the end user
$7,800 for a car $7,800 which is forcing the rivals I
guess they have rivals Gili and Cherry to have to lower their prices too so so
China the government Beijing just told the auto giants to quit their quote "No
winners price war madness before the entire industry crashes." So I guess I
guess it's not just China worrying about prices in other countries they're having a price war within China this that's
destroying their entire industry and so the uh so the bosses had to say "Cut it
out we'll see if that makes a difference meanwhile Financial Times is reporting that OPEC is boosting oil output for the
third consecutive month so that should cause prices to come down right i'm I'm
kind of amazed that there are still still increases in uh production of oil cuz
the price of oil is already down to the point where a lot of them can't make money
right right around 60 bucks a barrel that's where some people say "I'm out i
can't produce oil at less than that." Anyway but in a related story um
according to the Daily Color News Foundation uh they're talking about how Democrats
were claiming that Trump's tariffs would raise all of our prices but we haven't
seen that happen yet some of that might be because energy prices are going down
some of that might be because we have no idea if any tariffs
are even in place how many of you have any idea what real tariffs are in
place i don't um how how many uh how many
tariffs has Trump tried to put on people hundreds if you count all the different
uh countries and then how many of them have been um blocked by district
judges i don't know i've totally lost count how many of the ones that were blocked by district judges have then
been overturned by higher court i don't know i've lost count i have no idea
what's going on with tariffs i don't know do Do we have them do we have some of them but not all
of them i don't know i can't tell um but the it's funny that the Democrat
strategy seems to be to block all tariffs and then complain that the uh
tariffs don't ex don't don't raise prices well let me say that again the
Democrats would like to see prices rise so they can blame the tariffs but at the
same time they're blocking all those tariffs so even if it's true that the
tariffs would make prices rise and it's the only hope the Democrats have of ever
winning again is if prices rise the Democrats are blocking the tariffs so the prices can't
rise so So I'm not sure they have any kind of a coherent plan they should
either block them or uh or let the prices rise i guess we'll see where that
goes trump's approval level according to the Hill and a new a new poll by the
Decision Desk HQ um shows that he's doing pretty well so
his polling average is as high as 47.1 this past weekend and that would be
uh that would be a good number for Trump so in last two months he's gone up and
down but at the moment and I think that has everything to do with tariffs being put on
hold the public has no idea what's going on now you know the average voter if you
ask the average voter so what country does Trump have a tariff on that has not
been uh postponed or stalled by a core how many people could answer that
question so I think people are just sort of discounting the tariff thing like it
doesn't matter and if they like everything else Trump's doing they're like "Well we like
him." According to uh uh let's see where did I say this
wall Street Journal um conservatives kind of screwed themselves by making executive order
lawsuits uh against Biden so apparently during the Biden
administration when Biden was trying to do executive orders and conservatives were trying to stop him uh they came up
with some kind of uh major questions doctrine so the
courts came up with a major questions document doctrine so if it's a major
thing then Congress has to act on it but if it's not major let's say it's a tweak
or just a little redefinition of something then the executive order can stand
unfortunately while this might have been a clever thing for conservatives to do
uh it created a situation where now the left can use it against Trump and they
are so there's a unanimous decision by the US court of international trade that
relied in part on that major questions doctrine so it is true that anytime one
side comes up with a new tool to you know bash the other one on the head that
tool is going to bash them back as soon as things change and that's where we are
so the Wall Street Journal had a good article on that with Jess Braven and Jan Wolf meanwhile uh CNN's Harry Anton is
reporting that the courts have blocked Trump's agenda 181 times in four
months um that's over half of all the
cases and judicial lawfare of course looks like it's out of control
181 times it's like we don't even have a normal government all we have are
lawsuits we might as well just take everything to the court and just forget
about Congress and forget about executive orders and just say "All right lawyers it's going to be decided by the
court anyway so you take over." Anyway
um meanwhile the uh according to Fox News the Supreme Court has handed uh Trump a
win on revoking parole for the 500,000 foreign nationals
again I'm losing track so now they got the Supreme Court said
that the 500,000 migrants from Cuba Nicaragua and Venezuela can be
deported but is there anything stopping that so So it's sort of like
tariffs i I'm losing track over which challenges have worked and which hasn't
but it looks like Trump's doing better on immigration than he is on uh tariffs
in terms of the legal aspects of it so it looks like uh there'll be some
freedom to deport um
meanwhile according to uh where did this come from there's a
the Gaza food aid um is has been uh re- imagined so that
Hamas is not happy apparently the old way that um and not very old but you know the the
recent way that aid was given to the Gaza residents is that they'd send
trucks through with aid and the truck would try to go where the people are and
then Hamas would stop the truck and steal all the food and sell it so they could buy more stuff for
Hamas so basically it wasn't working so then um the change is that now the
people are going to come to where the food is so it's not stopping a bunch of
trucks uh Hamas would have to stop all the individuals so they tried they said
basically if you go get that free food we will kill
you imagine being a Gaza residence and the United States is trying to
distribute you food uh which is done by American contractors
but I think is paid for by Israel and maybe Saudi Arabia and some other some
other countries over there but if you're a Gaza resident you think that the
United States is helping you get food and Hamas is telling you that if you eat
that food they'll kill you so sort of I hate to say it's an ideal
situation for Israel but in terms of hearts and minds it looks like they've solved one
of the biggest problems which is if you're sending trucks of aid it doesn't work and Hamas gets stronger but if you
tell the people okay you're all in this little area now so go get some food and take it home
um apparently that works better cuz a Hamas can't kill everybody they might
try anyway uh I'm going to keep it short today um yesterday I was in extraordinary pain
but today I'm all good i don't know what the pain was and I don't know why it went away either but uh that's the good
news but anyway Owen Gregorian is going to have a spaces event right after we're
done and I'm just about done so look for Owen Gregorian on X and that'll give you
the link for the spaces or you can go to my account Scott Adam says and find the
spaces there all right uh yeah so today's a short one because
the news isn't giving us much and uh we've got something to do right after so
Owen I probably surprised you because I'm finishing a little earlier than usual but
uh go ahead and uh get that going and everybody wants to go there you can have
some extra fun and happy Saturday everybody
um I hope you all have a terrific time and I'm going to say just a few words to
the people on locals but I'm not going to keep them long the rest of you see
you see you tomorrow same time same place
