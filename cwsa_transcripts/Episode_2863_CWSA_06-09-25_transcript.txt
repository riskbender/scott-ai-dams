stock market is kind of flat so we don't have to worry about
that yet Let's uh get our comments working
and then we'll have a show Good morning Get rid of
that There we go
[Music]
Good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization It's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time But if
you'd like to take a chance on improving your attitude to levels that nobody can
even understand with their tiny shiny human brains Well all you need for that
is a copper mug or a glass a tanker shells or ste a canteen jugger flask a
vessel of any kind Fill it with your favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the
unparalleled pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day The thing that makes everything better It's called the
simultaneous and it happens now
Oh I feel sorry for the resistors You know I I hear that there
are some people I tried to talk before I was done
swallowing I'm a pig I hear that some people are trying
to resist the simultaneous sip because you don't want to feel like you've been
manipulated Well you also miss the thrill of being
connected to thousands of people around the world at the same time So you know I
guess you can pick your fate All right So allegedly in science according to
wonderful engineering uh scientists have created light from
empty space by manipulating time and space or the other possibility is that
is total and nobody created any light whatsoever I look at a story like that
and I just think really really did they make light out of time and
space did that really happen i don't know It might have but uh
I'm going to say you're going to need a little bit more evidence before I say
yes to that Meanwhile in something way more fun
there's a company called Cuda Jet that makes an underwater jetpack It looks
like it's obviously electric and you strap it to your back and you can just
go like hell on you know underwater and at the surface And I said to
myself this looks really fun It looks really really fun So I could
easily imagine myself uh seeing lots of people doing that I was going to say me
doing it but you know it's not like I'm going to scuba either So I don't think
I'll be doing it But it looks like fun It It can uh last 90 minutes which is
probably the hard part having the battery last long enough and it can recharge in 75 minutes and you can feel
like you're you're Aquaman and Superman at the same time Well in uh important New York Post
news uh allegedly the average penis size has
increased and OMPic could be to blame So anecdotally but not
scientifically yet Anecdotally people are reporting that their penises are larger
uh when they're on OMIC losing weight Now may I
uh may I address the NPCs directly npcs
what you should say is the most obvious thing What's the most obvious
thing you would say oh it's not any bigger It's just that you can see it now
That's the most obvious thing you can say So if you were if you were already
typing that sorry you're an NPC You're not
programmed for creativity You're programmed for the most obvious
things So sorry about that Uh when I see a story like this I have
to wonder do you think the uh PR department at Ozembic could possibly be
behind this story now not that they you know made up the story out of nothing It
could be that uh you know there were reports actual reports but they were
anecdotal so it didn't really mean anything But if you were the PR department and you had this potential
story do you think you would call up the New York Post and say "How would you
like an exclusive story about how penises get bigger when you take OMIC?"
Now if the PR department at Ozmpic did not do
that I think they all need to be fired because I can't think of a way to sell
more OSMIC than that I mean the weight loss is good but doesn't really come
close to the other thing Meanwhile Apple uh is got a big event
today and uh the general feeling is that we're all going to be
disappointed and that uh whatever they say about AI for example is going to be
underwhelming My understanding is I didn't see it personally but my
understanding is that Apple has recently made some negative comments about AI in
general just AI in general which would suggest that they don't think it's
either good enough or ready enough to be in their products
Now my guess is that they tried really really hard to build AI into their
products you know as prototypes just to see what they could do And that they
couldn't get past the uh hallucinations If you can't get past the
hallucinations and you can't make it go get you information there's not much you
can do except it's really good at uh I'll tell you my my Apple phone
uh the fact that it understands me when I talk to it which it did not a year ago
is a really big deal I mean because I do talk to it a lot but just setting alarms
and stuff Anyway so we'll see if uh Apple excites us or disappoints us Here
is the least surprising story of all time Uh apparently there's new information
that came out that uh the CIA was behind
starting the stories that Area 51 had some UFOs because it turns out they were just
trying to have a cover story for the fact that there were some advanced uh
aircraft that they were working on and they didn't want people to think it was
our stuff Now how many of
you assumed that was true because I remember I was reading
the story and I said to myself doesn't everybody know that but then I realized
that I didn't know that I just assumed because I start with the
assumption there are no UFOs and then I had progressed to why
would we think there are UFOs and who would ever have a you know any kind of benefit by saying they're
UFOs and then I think oh well there there are other documents we've seen
from the 80s maybe where the CIA did
consciously say "Let's start a UFO story to hide some things we're
doing." Now that was unrelated to this but if it's a known strategy
um it makes you wonder about all those drones we were worrying about 6 months
ago How long ago were we worrying about all the activity and and then people started
saying it's it's UFOs It's UFOs you show me a uh claim of a UFO and I
will automatically think that the CIA might be behind it even if they're not I
mean it's just automatically where I go But here's a here's a question I
ask Um first of all is it really possible to know for sure that this is
true because it's the CIA so what if the UFOs are
real but the CIA is covering up for the real UFOs by claiming that there were
American aircraft so you can't be so sure You
don't know what's true Um but I do wonder is there anybody who has
dedicated their adult life to learning about and pursuing the Area 51
UFOs who when they read something like this and they see it was just all a big CIA plot do they say to themselves "Oh
wow I wasted my adult life worrying about this thing that was totally made
up." And the answer is probably no
one Because if you believed it was true before you're going to do what I did
just a minute ago and you're going to find a reason why it's still true despite all evidence to the contrary
You'll say "Nope that's exactly how they cover these things up." That's what you'll
say Well apparently there's this uh news person ABC news person called Terry
Moran Uh not but Moran And uh he got I guess he got put
on suspension because he got caught with some hatefilled rant about Trump Uh no
not about Trump about Steven Miller So here's what he said about Steven Miller This is in an article in
the postmillennial by Victor Davis Hansen
and Moran wrote on uh on a post on X oh
on Sunday he said quote the thing about Steven Miller Miller is not that he is
the brains behind Trumpism yes he is one of the people who conceptualizes the
impulses of the Trumpist movement which is a real good sentence by the way uh
and translates slim into policy That's a really good sentence Um but that's not
what's interesting about Miller So here comes the uh the bad part He says it's
not brains it's bile Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for
hatred He's a worldclass hater You can see this just by looking at him because
you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment He eats his hate
Now imagine being ABC news executives and one of your news people just imagine
that he look within the soul of a uh you know one of the key people in the
administration and they can look deep into his soul which is a capability we
don't have by the way uh and that he can see all this bile and the hatreds that
are that there is spiritual nourishment He eats his
hate Where does that even come from now I do understand that if you've
been watching Stephen Miller for a while he he's always the most hardcore on
immigration but that has a reason It's not like he's doing it for fun And it's
also not exactly uh something that's you know gonna nourish you You know if
you're the one who takes the least popular opinion or at least the one you
know is going to get you the most heat I don't know That that seems like somebody
who's uh stepping into the brereech and doing the thing that you and I wish
would get done which is control the border But we don't want to take the
heat for being the the lead person on that but he takes the heat
Um I will say that he has one of these uh TV
personas that suggests you know if you were going to cast him in a movie the
same thing I said about Rahm Emanuel if you were going to cast a movie with a
let's say a um an evil super genius like Lex
Luthther you can kind of see Steven Miller right you know even if we like
him even if you like what he's doing which I do um you can kind of see it
right and unfortunately uh we're such a visual creatures that if
he looks one way uh but he talks another way you're you're mostly going to be
influenced by how he looks I have that same question about Corey Booker When Cy
Booker talks his eyes get so big that they're comical and he looks like I
don't want to say he looks like an idiot but his eyes are too
big He just opens them too far and it it doesn't look like he's telling you the
truth Now I don't know if he is Sometimes he probably does but he's a
politician so sometimes maybe not But how in the world did he ever get
elected with that face have you ever looked at anybody from let's say another
state where you know you weren't directly involved and you see the representative and you say "How did that
representative get elected?" really with that look There are just some
looks that you you think would be hard to win an election Anyway the uh San
Francisco Police Department arrested 60 people yesterday
uh made a violent protest This is according to Just the News and uh dozens
of police officers responded and it was this was also about the ICE and
deportation stuff So the the big protests and the riots that are happening in LA and San Francisco and
New York that I know of uh are about reducing the power of ICE
to deport people Now how many of you think that's
organic that that people were sitting at home and they thought to themselves you know what of all the problems I have the
one I really need to spend some time on and the one that's the most dangerous because you know you end up in jail get
a criminal record is uh this issue of border control I want less border
control I don't think anybody had that thought
This thing is so obviously artificial that it's you know sort of
funny When was it that uh do you remember the first time I told you that
this summer there would be protests and I didn't know what the protests would be but if it's summer
there will be protests And uh so anyway San Francisco was the
smaller part of it The bigger part of it was in LA According to Breitbart News uh there
will be some more specially trained border patrol uh agents deployed to Los
Angeles To which my curiosity says to me specially trained you say specially
trained to do what to reduce tensions and
riots or what so Randy Clark and Brebar News is writing about that So we don't
know what that's all about but uh Trump has ordered 2,000 National Guardmen to
respond And he said that the uh I think I think Trump said that they'll be
everywhere and they'll take care of it Um according to a CBS News
poll 54% of those uh surveyed support
President Trump's uh program uh for um
deportation So not just the border security but 54% approve of his
deportation program Um and 42% think uh the program has made
America safer while 30% said it's made the country less safe How in the
world is the country as a whole less safe because we deported 10,000
criminals what is even the point of having surveys
if the answers that come back are so obviously stupid or biased or political that they're just
meaningless there's nobody who thinks the country is is in more danger because
the criminals were deported Now I get that you know there's there's the risk during the uh ICE raid
that someone might get hurt I get that But even if you include all of
that getting rid of 10,000 I'm just picking a number but getting rid of
10,000 known repeat criminals that's definitely going to make you safer Getting rid of a known
South American gang Yeah that's uh that's going to make you safer Yeah So everybody who had the
wrong answer All right So what is the most
important thing to know about the LA riots well other people will cover
things like how many people were injured and you know what's the cost of it all
and how many how many law enforcement people have been surged and did they do
a good good job But uh I'm gonna cover the word
play because somehow this is a sort of artificial event that's designed to
create a lot of uh Democrat friendly word play So the first part is are they
riots or protests well if you're the mainstream media you get to call them protests
If uh if they were talking about somebody they didn't like would they call it a protest or would they call it
a riot i don't know if they've uh has the mainstream yet turned it into riot or
they still sticking with protest So that's the first word play
thing to watch out for to see if they treat it like it's a protest
The other thing that um I don't know if anybody else picked up on this but
suppose you were somebody who planned let's say you were Soros or something
and you planned to fund uh big riots in San in LA and San
Francisco So let's say you your idea was that if you fund these riots you'll get
some kind of benefit you know could be any kind of benefit but you've decided to fund them What would you know would
be the natural outcome to Karen Bass the
mayor of uh LA and Governor Nuome
is there any reasonable way that when this is done people are going to say
"Wow you two did a great job." Actually
none because it's it's simply going to look like they're in charge when uh you
can't get to where you want to get because the you know the roads are closed and you're going to see endless
loops of whatever violence the cameras can pick up I don't know how what it is
as a percentage of activity but uh doesn't it seem to you
that maybe maybe whoever's in charge of funding this is trying to take Karen
Bass and Newsome off the the off the table at the same time in an unrelated
story or or is it unrelated is this story related or
unrelated separately there's a story that uh Kla Harris has remained
unusually silent during the uh during the protests
Now if you wanted Kla Harris to either run for president or governor of
California and you didn't care too much about Karen Ba Bass either because she
wasn't helping you it would be kind of clever to fund a bunch of riots that make Newsome and
Bass look like they're completely you know unable to run anything while having
Kla Harris just go quiet don't say anything about anything and then she'll
be fresh and unspoiled whenever the uh whenever the dust
settles So that's just my speculation There's no evidence that
um so 2000 National Guard
Does it seem to you that this is another one of those 8020
questions where uh Trump is very solidly on the 80 when is the last time you met anybody
in the real world who thought it was a bad idea to send the National Guard to
have a little bit more force than it might make sense because if you threaten
with enough force then you get what you want without the force How many of
you like have you even talked to anybody who thinks that's a bad idea it's got to be at least 8020 right
in favor of it So once again the Democrats have figured out how to find
uh the most unpopular thing you could imagine which is hey suppose we make
your traffic worse We damage your downtowns so that
you you lose your retail business and uh we try to open up the
border and keep as many criminals in the country as we can That doesn't even really sound
like it could be happening in the real world It's so
ridiculously stupid But it fits everything Democrats have been doing for the last five years
right just unbelievably stupid But somehow they think they can
get some word play out of it So here's some more word play
Um chaotic Remember I told you that uh the Democrats were going to say that
the the uh riots andor protests were sort of a natural you know free speech
but the chaos the chaos would be coming from the
people who are trying to stop the violence and the protests I think they're trying to stop
the violence not the protests And sure enough sure enough you wake up
and everybody's like "It's chaotic." Uh Trump Trump is making everything chaotic
So chaotic All right Word play The other thing we have to agree on is uh I think
we need to have a uh constitutional convention That's the wrong thing but
just sounded funny uh to decide what the word most or mostly
means Do you know how important that is hey Scott how much violence is there at
the protest it's mostly mostly
peaceful So what did you just learn from that nothing
most most uh protests no ma no matter how violent they get I would bet you
that even in the worst situation no more than 20% of the
participants would be breaking things and setting them on fire and hurting people in the worst situation And we're
not anywhere near that We're more in the you know 2% 5% situation But uh no we
should decide Does mostly mean more than 50% Does mostly mean
uh less than 10% of the people are being
violent We we can't even talk about these things without knowing what that
word means So Democrats word play That's
all they got All right So we got some uh Whimo cars are on fire Um and here's another
word that uh is sort of a Governor Nuomoe word play He said uh this is a
serious moment and it requires serious
leadership And where's your decency Mr president blah blah blah blah blah It's
immoral Those are all words aren't they uh do you think that Trump was
unaware that this was a serious situation do you think that Governor
Nuomo was actually under the belief that Trump didn't understand that a major
riot in in LA and other other cities was a major serious thing
if Trump is not taking it seriously what are those 2,000 National Guard people
doing are they just having fun playing beer pong and waiting for things to
settle down no I think he's taking it pretty seriously But again the Democrats
don't have arguments They just have word play So
it's a chaotic situation and uh it's mostly peaceful
and uh Trump isn't taking it seriously Which part of that told you
anything none of it There's no information in any of that It's
completely contentfree communication There's no argument There's no data There's nothing
to agree with There's nothing to disagree with It's literally just word
play Anyway where's your decency Mr President i'll say it again It's immoral
All right maybe you should say it more than once It's immoral What part of it is
immoral is it immoral to try to protect the innocent people whose storefronts
might be destroyed by a mob is that immoral is it immoral to deport people
who are at this point are criminal is it immoral to have a
border i think even the pope is in favor of a little bit of law and order isn't
he that would be a good question for the pope Pope is this immoral well you know
six of one half dozen the other So uh and by the way how many of
you thought that Governor Nuome was your moral compass because when I want to know
what's moral I say to myself well what did Governor Nuome say i mean I have my
own opinions but until I hear what the most moral person in the world says about it I know it's up in
here Anyway so it looks like another Trump 8020
win and we'll see how that unfolds Uh meanwhile we've got a tough
guy competition uh where Governor Nuome um is is saying
that he's daring Tom Hman to arrest him
He says "Come after me Arrest me Let's just get it over with tough guy."
That's what uh that's what Newsome said and that's because uh Tomman said that
if anybody interferes with the work of ICE that they might arrest him and then
Newsome is like come after me big boy Yeah Come after me
I I feel like uh nothing would make Newsome happier than getting
arrested because it would take him off the field when there's nothing he can do on the field that's helping whatsoever
But it would be this great visual you if you saw him like perwalked with the handcuffs on and you say to yourself "My
god that Trump has overreached He's gone to full authoritarianism."
So I don't think Tom Hman needs any advice because he's been pretty awesome
But let me give you some advice Tom Hman Don't arrest that guy Arrest anybody else you want but
don't arrest the guy who wants to be arrested Yeah you don't want that He
He's a theater kid and uh he would enjoy it too much
Well Jonathan Turley has a uh article today that uh is very similar to
something I've said recently so therefore I like it extra but he was
writing I forgot where he was writing it but it's a Jonathan Turley um article
and he's saying that uh that uh executives around the country
are getting to do things they wanted to do but they didn't want to be seen as
being in favor of it such as getting rid of DEI But
apparently at least anecdotally there are a bunch of executives who definitely
wanted to get rid of DEI but they couldn't do it until they could blame Trump So now it's well you
know Trump made me do it I really didn't want to I wanted
extra DEI not not less of it But uh that damn Trump he just made me get rid of it
because otherwise our insurance would go up too much and well we just couldn't afford it as much as we wanted it So I
agree I think uh I think Trump made me do it It might be helping a lot of
people that we don't know about Well the new head of the Social
Security Administration um says that they want to become a
digital first department meaning get everything digitized in a way that uh I
think most of us assumed had already been done Didn't you kind of assume that the
big government programs like Social Security were uh you know first rate
technology i I never really thought about it too hard but if you would stop me and say
"How good do you think the technology is for social security?" And I always said "Well obviously if it's on a date they
would have fixed that a long time ago because it's such an important system so my guess would be uh it's pretty
advanced." Well nothing like that's true Turns out that the social security
system uh is aging and uh needs a total
overhaul to be digital first And so the new head of social security is going to
use uh some of the Doge staffers and the
Doge process I think to get that done So
that's actually kind of exciting because if they designed the system right you don't
have to go looking for all the fraud It would just prevent the fraud from happening in the first place So that'd
be good All right the funniest story of the day I think it's the funniest story of
the day even funnier than the Yumping story is that as you know the DNC has uh
co-chairs So it's not one person who's the head of the DNC it's two Uh one of
them is David Hog What's the name of the other one how many of you can name the
co-chair who is not David Hog in the comments
go Well while you're doing that it'll take take a while for your comments to show up while you're doing that Uh the
reporting is if you want to believe the reporting um according to
Politico they got a copy of the recording uh that the uh the co-chair
his name is Ken Martin he he was addressing Hog directly during a recent Zoom meeting and he said quote "I'll be
very honest with you For the first time in my 100 days on this job the other night I said to myself for the first
time I don't know if I want to do this anymore Martin said And then he said no
one knew No one knows who the hell I am
Right No one knows who the hell I am Can you imagine being Ken Martin and you're
trying to do the business of the DNC and you call somebody up and you say "Hey
this is Ken Martin." And whoever answers his phone has no idea who you
are But if David Hog called they'd be like "Oh David Hog co-chair of the DNC."
So in one way you could look at this as a slight condemnation of uh Ken Martin
because he hasn't done enough to distinguish himself But on the other
hand it's sort of a compliment to David Hog who sucked all the energy out of the
room Now you know when Trump does it when Trump sucks all the energy out of a
room I compliment him So I'm going to be consistent You don't have to love what
David Hog is doing You don't have to love his opinions or anything about him But when he go he goes into a situation
and sucks all the energy out of the room so you don't even know who his coach is
well that does suggest a level of skill which is not an accident So I would keep
an eye on him He's I I think his flaws are almost entirely based on being
young and that is self-healing So I hate to tell you but
as ineffective as David Hog seems today his raw skill level and his just
personality and charisma really do make him a threat for the future So if
someday there's a president uh hog don't be don't be shocked I don't think it'll
happen for you know 30 years but he's got plenty of time to mature and learn
all the uh the smart ways to do stuff So remember he's not dumb
um some some of the uh Democrats that you you like to criticize are actually
not very smart but he's not one of those He's he's actually very smart He's just
inexperienced and that as I say is self-healing So watch out for him
Um let's talk about Cash Patel and Epstein as we have a hundred times
Uh so Cash Patel says that there are no videos of
uh let's say famous people doing horrible things to victims on Epstein
Island But my question would be how would we ever know if such things
existed at one time and somebody just took them away that wouldn't be knowable
would it but wasn't there like a a room that Cash
Patel recently found that had a whole bunch of documents in it that nobody even knew was a storage room for
sensitive documents well what if they never found that room we would just assume that all
the stuff in that room was non-existent because nobody could find it
So I don't think it means anything when Cash Patel says these you know there's
no documents that exist that would show that uh Epstein was murdered or that uh
any celebrities did any terrible crimes on the island The only thing we know for
sure well we don't even know that for sure but probably I would give him the
benefit of a doubt The one thing we know for sure uh or mostly for sure is that he doesn't
have it So I do believe him when he says I don't have any you know damning evidence
of famous people but even that could be you know something that's a state secret
Wouldn't it be a state secret if we had some other head of state doing bad
things on the island do you think that Cash Patel
would have the authority uh or even would think it's a good idea
to out some other head of state or a family member of a head of state that would be a terrible idea
because we would create this whole uh this whole animosity with some other
countries that we didn't really need to Now would justice be served nope But
when you're dealing with international uh relations you end up doing all these
terrible tradeoffs You know people die if they do this but people die if they do the other thing So international
relations is a contact sport So even though there might be a
situation where uh justice would not be satisfied you can imagine that that
would be a state secret because it's a messy world So if
it sounds like I'm in favor of that then check yourself because I didn't say that
I'm just saying that that might be the reality of it Anyway
um what else we got going on oh Cash Patel also said they found the missing
Fouchy phone I guess one of his older phones they hadn't been able to find for years but somehow magically they found
it Do you think there's going to be anything on Fouch's phone by now
that uh would cause trouble I don't know I'm I'm so cheated
Even though this has nothing to do with the Epstein files you know the Fouchy phone and the Epstein files no
connection You know if you imagined anything about one that affected the other would be analogy thinking so it
wouldn't even be good thinking But there's something about just what
we've been observing for the last several years that makes me think that there will be nothing interesting on
Fouch's phone because every time we think we've got something it's like ah
we got them We found the secret documents We've you know it just doesn't
really work out that way does it so I'm going to say that there will be
no major Fouchy revelations unless they're just sort of embarrassing or interesting or funny but
nothing that's going to make him go to jail All right Um according
to federal appeals court uh Trump will be allowed to ban the AP
the Associated Press from the Oval Office a two to one ruling that uh
blocked the lower courts uh block or something [Music] Um so what do you think of that do you
think it's uh do you think it's fair that Trump can block one part of the
major media well here's a little uh persuasion
lesson for you If he blocked all of the major media that said things that were
untrue and maybe they even knew they were untrue then there would be no media
left for his press events If he blocked nobody just nobody
got any push back then the the bad media would feel free to make up more lies
about him and not worry about it But if you can take one of them in this
case the AP and drive a stake through their heart and
say this could be you You know if if you do the same thing that they did we'll
drive a stake through your heart too because you don't have automatic access to the White House
And so persuasionwise uh putting a stake through the heart of
one major you know brand name media enterprise is the very smartest thing he
could do because it's going to make all the rest of them say uh maybe we should look twice at the way we're wording this
And that's what he would want So smart
Um meanwhile in uh news that is a little bit
alarming the Trump administration has allegedly according to the New York Post
diverted 20,000 anti- drone missiles uh that were meant for Ukraine and
they're being sent to US troops in the Middle East Now why would US troops in the
Middle East suddenly need 20,000 anti- drone
missiles do we need them more than we needed them a month ago
is it just a uh ordinary increase in
capacity and uh a change in priorities where Trump says "Okay Ukraine is less
important US is more important so we're going to move them." All right you're way ahead of me in the comments You're
way ahead of me Yeah it kind of suggests that we're preparing for a war
with Iran Now I always I always tell you this
preparing for war does not mean war Preparing for war just means you
have a military If your military has not prepared for every you know likely or
even potential war they're not really doing their job So would it make sense
even if we had no intention of starting a war would it make sense for us to move
a bunch of weapons into the US control away from Ukraine and the answer
is probably probably makes sense to move those weapons Um but it also makes a uh
a good warning for Iran So if Iran thinks we're preparing for a war do you
think they'll be a little more flexible they should You know they're
not super flexible right now but um it's got to feel different if you're if the only thing
happening is the boats are setting off the coast I mean that's scary enough But
if the boats are you know the ships if they're sitting off the coast of your country and they're warships and you
just heard that 20,000 anti- drone missiles just got delivered then you're going to be a
little bit more worried So I always wonder if this sort of story
is planted and that the real customer for it is Iran so that they can look at
it and say "Whoa looks like they're changing their focus to us." So but it
could be unrelated Um Russia is apparently increasing their
offensive into Ukraine and they're going into the
Dinopro region Now if you're wondering how to pronounce that correctly um
that's why you come to me It's called
Denipro region and that's very important Um and apparently the uh it's just above
Crimea somebody said So if you were walking you know toward the center of Ukraine you'd start in Crimea and then
you would have to pass through pro
proet region and uh Russia really wants that apparently So it's making a major
push um to try to get it So that sort of suggests that Putin is
not planning for peace anytime soon
Um I always tell you about all the uh you know I always well I one more
thing about the um Russian incursion Do you think the Ukrainians
are saying to themselves you know what we'd really we could use right now
20,000 anti- drone missiles That would really help us right now Anyway
um I always tell you these stories about uh electric batteries that are you know
new technology I don't tell you all of them because there's probably more than
one of them every day And when I do tell you about them I remind you it's not
that this particular one is going to become the standard in the future But
once you get a sense of how many battery related breakthroughs there are like
just major breakthroughs um then you just add to that all you need is some big car
company to want to use that technology and operationalize it But interesting
engineering is talking about a uh new battery breakthrough
um a Serbian company So they've they've got this
battery that you can get an 80% charge in 12 minutes and it will last 310,000
miles Uh I mean that's that's the lifespan of the battery
and it can charge that 80% in just 12 minutes 12
minutes That's pretty impressive Anyway so the battery stuff is what um those
breakthroughs are what make your ebikes work and your your electric cars and your your underwater
uh jetpacks and very soon your
aircraft So I'm pretty sure aircraft will alter electric at some point seems
impossible because you know aircraft require a well
not jets I don't think you'd be able to replace jets but you'd probably be be
able to replace a lot of local you know short hall aircraft
stuff well there's a story that says uh China and the US are meeting on Monday
uh in London to talk about a rare earth deal Now how does that fit with the news
we were already told which is that Trump said that he made a deal with she for
rare earth minerals What was that about cuz you
know at the time I thought to myself well not really There there's not really any chance that the two of them hash
down a mineral deal or was there some particular sticking point that Trump
removed um that allowed them to have serious negotiations but what we don't have is
any kind of a mineral deal with China And I don't really understand why there would be
um unless they also felt like they could make deals on all the other stuff
because the mineral deal you know the rare earth stuff that feels like where
they've really got us by the gonads if you know what I mean like more so than
anything else that they do So why would they give that up first in what world would you
negotiate by giving up your main leverage before you even talked about
your other stuff So there's something going on here with this story that I don't understand
doesn't make sense with what I know about negotiations or people or Trump or
President Xi or China It doesn't make sense So if somebody can figure out what
is it I don't understand about this story which might be just everything I don't know Uh let me know because I'm
very curious because we under no circumstances does it make sense that
China and the US would be negotiating the the highest leverage part of the
trade deal unless China just went crazy and
decided that they don't want their best leverage I don't know does make
sense So ladies and gentlemen that is what I want to tell you
today and uh hope you enjoyed the show I'm going to say hi to the uh local
subscribers privately and the rest of you have a wonderful Monday I think it's
a perfect summer day and uh you'll enjoy it So locals here I come in 30 seconds
Everybody else I'll see you tomorrow Same time same place
