here I am So what do you want to do do a show do a podcast
yes we will But first uh stock market is kind of flat
Kind of flat Kind of boring Let's do a podcast
[Music] Almost ready
Everything's working today Look at that
[Music] Good morning everybody and welcome to
the highlight of Cuban civilization It's called Coffee with Scott Adams because
that's what it is But if you'd like to take your experience up to levels that
no one can even understand whether they're tiny shiny human brains all you
need for that is a cup or a mug or a glass a tank or
chalice or stein a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind Fill it with your
favorite liquid I like coffee And join me now for the unparalleled
pleasure of the dopamine hit of the day The thing that makes everything better It's called the simultaneous sip and it
happens right now Go
Oh that was good Oh freshly bathed coffee
All right And I wonder I wonder wonder if uh there's any
science that could have been avoided by just asking me Oh here's one According
to Eric Dolan and Cypost it's always Eric Um there's this mega
study that shows and I know this will be surprising
that exercise boosts cognitive function across all ages and health conditions
That's right Exercise is good for your brain You know how else you could have
determined this without doing a mega study you could have asked me "Hey Scott is
there any situation in which exercise is ever neutral or bad
for brains?" And I would say "No
no there is not It's always good for your brain because your body and your
brain are the same thing It's the same tool." Um yep But uh the thing they added that
they think is new is that it's every every
um every kind of exercise and every kind of brain in every situation
So the intensity did not matter Yoga and dance just as good which I might have
known I'm not sure All right Uh here's another one Let's
see if you can uh get this one first Um do Democrats dislike Republicans
the same amount as Republicans dislike Democrats
do you know this one it's a new study Uh well it turns out this is also a side
post Eric Dolan again Uh it turns out that Democrats do dislike Republicans
more than Republicans dislike Democrats according to a study
How many of you did not know that you all knew that every one of you Uh the
reason seems to be that uh uh Democrats believe that Republicans
have a more negative opinion of uh people who are you know minorities or
have some kind of issues trouble Um all right But I would argue the
Republicans just have a bigger picture Meaning
if uh if he said to a Democrat um I need to remove this benefit
from this one person but it will save the whole world The Democrat would say
you monster You can't you can't take that benefit away from that one person
And then the Republican would say no you missed the part where I said that would
save the entire world and the Democrat would say "I I don't even know what you're talking about You
would be mean to this person." So sort of like that
All right Here's another one Do you think that a Tik Tok video
um if it's edited for you know persuasion
uh can change how voters see politicians
what do you think a Tik Tok video Could it be influential in uh changing
how you see a politician yes
Again it's Eric Nolan and Cypos Yes obviously
So but apparently they did a study and they found out that
uh not only can you change how people see politicians you know their your
favorability but it's uh especially strong for Donald Trump
So Trump is right that Tik Tok works in his favor
So visuals are influential
Well in the bad news um Boeing Dreamliner had a horrible
crash um Air India It went down and killed u many of the
242 on board Now the reason it wasn't all of them is they had just taken off
But uh let me give you some advice about that story
which is I saw a warning that the video is especially hard to look at and I said
to myself how hard can it be and I watched the video
Um let me give you some advice Don't watch the videos There were lots of
videos of people who got to the crash site when it was fresh
Do not watch them Do do not It will not make your day
better Do not watch them All right Um Trump and uh Melania
went to the uh what is it the Kennedy Center and they watched Le Miserab
That's my French Excuse my French
Um and uh they had a good time Apparently it's the president's favorite
favorite play or musical or whatever Now
um it reminded me of the balance that the president is trying to find between
austerity because you know we don't have infinite money and making sure that
America doesn't you know just um rot basically So I
don't love it when he wants to spend extra on Air Force One but I understand
that it's a symbol of the country and you want to keep the president safe and you know it makes sense I didn't love it
when Trump said he was going to build a ballroom at the White House because again we've got these these big deficits
But on the other hand it is a a symbol of the the country's health It's like
the the beating heart of the country So making sure the beating heart of the
country is not only working but it's extra You know it's got a ballroom
I can say it's good for the you know the mind of the country
and he's he's going to put some money into fixing up the Kennedy Center And I
thought to myself I'll never go to the Kennedy Center Why do I care and then I
thought oh okay it's a high visibility kind of a situation
And uh yeah and I definitely don't like the idea of a military parade
I I just don't like anything about that it's spending money it's probably
damaging the streets Um you know it just doesn't look right But
on the other hand it does make the country look like it's powerful and you
know nobody should mess with it So even though some of my instincts
um sort of argue against these Trump-like expenses
I feel like he's right And you know my instinct is wrong because you got to
protect the symbols You know that the United States is more than you know just
the people in the money and the military It's also a you know it's an idea
and uh Trump keeping the idea of America strong by making sure these these
symbols don't rot Um he he's right Yeah that's that's the
right play Meanwhile according to Newsmax
I didn't see this anywhere else but Newsmax says that the DNC has voted to
oust Vice Chair David Hog So um and also
Malcolm Kenyatta I don't know who that is but I guess
they were both vice chairs And uh it's over a technical complaint
um that that was the excuse they made but they uh slaughtered their hog
finally Now I've been telling you before that I think David Hog should not be
underestimated because like AOC he does have skill and
if you free him from the confines of being in the DNC which you know has a
limited role it might might make him stronger
So keep an eye on him Keep an eye on him Um
in good news PJ Media is reporting that uh GM is going to invest $4 billion
in US-based manufacturing plants Um I guess that's because of a a response to
tariffs on Mexico So that would be a win for President
Trump as he's trying to uh financially incentivize companies to move to US for
production and that's exactly what's happening So good for you President Trump
Uh meanwhile there's a story in futurism by Victor
Tangerman who says that um CEOs of major companies
are trying to make AI copies of themselves um so that the AI copy can answer the
you know sort of routine questions the CEO is always asked But they have a
problem with hallucinations So
uh the main problem with AI is hallucinations
and nobody's figured out how to get past that But I thought I would solve that
today Um because all these CEOs need it and I needed to I guess uh some of the
startups they've used would be like uh personal AI These are
startups that allow you to clone a person And unfortunately they all have
the problem of hallucination Deli which I've tested and Tavis I've
never heard of But anyway um each one of those and any
other AI as well is going to give you a hallucinations But would you like me to solve that
problem right now all right Okay If you demand it I will
Um all you need is to have three AIs
you know three not three models but three completely different AIs And you
have one AI that's in charge of speaking but you have everything it says tested
first on the other AIs So you have two AIs that fact check the third AI and the
third AI is the only one that gets to talk Now what are the odds that three
different AIs would have the same hallucination
i think the odds would be close to zero right unless the models were also
coincidentally trained exactly the same way in the same order on the same data
which I don't think happens But you tell me what are the odds that
all three AIs would hallucinate the same thing
i feel like it wouldn't So I'm wondering if the real the real problem is that
people don't want to pay for three AIS You know if you had Grock and Chad GBT
and Anthropic would they all agree on the hallucination
now doesn't that seem too simple are any of you uh AI experts
when when you hear my idea do you say to yourself you idiot you you forgot the
you know most important thing about AI I don't know Did I i might have
But doesn't it seem to you like that would work like every time
it I don't see how it wouldn't work But anyway so if you wanted AI to be
solved there you go I just fixed it
maybe All right The uh Trump administration according to
RSBN is evacuating the Middle East embassies
at least the non-critical people um over concerns about Iran
Now here's my question If we're evacuating our Middle East
embassies the only reason is we think there's a too much risk that Iran will attack them
Now what would make Iran attack a US embassy
well the only thing I can think of is if uh Israel attacked Iran
So didn't we always have that risk you know
for months and months and months if not years Why are we
why are we drawing down the staff now i can only think of one reason
where well two one we know that an attack is coming That would be the most
obvious or two it's part of negotiations because it it suggests that an attack is
imminent and maybe that's what we need to get Iran to agree But
I've been watching Iran for you know much of my adult life and um they don't
seem really susceptible to threats It's sort of the opposite Uh very much
the opposite actually So are we being told that there's a military action
that's imminent and how imminent would we be evacuating you know a week
before it happens or maybe we did it months before it
happens because we don't want to give away too much I don't know It looks to me like there's
going to be some military action
Um speaking of Iran uh according to the Wall Street Journal
the IAEA board so the weird thing about
Iran is that we're having all these you know nuclear energy nuclear weapon
um negotiations But at the same time this IAEA
has been u monitoring their activity Now
it's not enough of a monitor to make a difference It doesn't stop them from doing what they're doing apparently But
the uh the AEA just found that Iran is in
non-compliance um for the first time in 20 years
First time in 20 years Really there's nothing non-compliant they've done in
the nuclear category for 20 years What's all this talk about then all right Well
so apparently it has to do with uh what is it there's something unexplained
that Iran is not explaining So this uh this board is saying if you
can't explain this then you're in non-compliance So what did Iran do being in
non-compliance well it said it would open a new uranium
enrichment facility Um so it's going to do more of whatever we
don't like Okay Um according to um experts Iran is already
producing enough highlyenriched uranium for one nuclear weapons worth a month
That doesn't mean they're making weapons It means they have enough enriched uranium
Anyway so uh the IAEA um might uh lead to some kind of UN
security council action and uh there could be some repercussions
there but things are heating up and uh so my question is this
um Iran's entire approach is saying oh no we don't want a nuclear weapon
No no no We need all this uranium enrichment for you know peaceful
purposes for medical devices and you know just ordinary business
But why would anybody act this way if they had only peaceful intentions
nobody would right you know in in your wildest imagination
can you imagine anybody going to the brink of war and in all likelihood
actual war over their insistence
that uh there's going to be you know totally peaceful non-military
uh work on nuclear Nobody would do that Nobody would do
that So they've signaled as strongly as they can that they plan to have nuclear
weapons or at least the ability to very quickly have nuclear weapons which would
be you know pretty dangerous on its own So given that um I think Trump said his
uh optimism about a deal is kind of low right now
Um we're pretty much guaranteed to have military action aren't we the only thing
that's a mystery is how much involvement the US might have But it does look to me
like Israel is going to act and maybe
maybe the uh the UN action where they're finding them you know being in
non-compliance maybe that's the trigger So I wouldn't be surprised
if uh you see some war happening this summer
Um meanwhile Newsmax is reporting that the
US budget deficit fell 9% in May and the
reason is that tariffs boosted uh boosted our revenue
So all right So apparently there would have been a
$316 billion budget deficit Um but it's down 31 billion because of um tariffs
All right I didn't know that tariffs would make a difference And I think some of these
tariffs are temporary so don't get too excited
Meanwhile there is alleg allegedly a China trade
deal And uh so I was looking at the Wall Street
Journal to report on what the trade deal is all about and I cannot tell if the
trade deal is good or bad for America Can you
is there any way to tell if the trade deal is good or bad for America i mean I
look at it and I say "All right so so China is going to loosen up on their
uh the rare earth minerals um hold back." To which I say wouldn't that be
just going back to where we were but a little bit worse
because there's some kind of limit on it or you know now we know they can pull it anytime they want So it's nice to have
our rare earth mineral source back but that didn't put us ahead
That's sort of where we were before Then there's uh
let's see what else we got Uh we're going to restrict the most advanced AI
chips from China which is where we already were Okay Um
we're going to allow Chinese student visas so they can go to college in the United
States which is where we were
right there's nothing new about that We're just going back to where we were
And then there's something about tariffs but neither China nor the US seem to be
um mad about the tariffs they've agreed to which sort of suggests that we're just
going back to where we were So can anybody give me an argument about
how we came out ahead did we come out ahead on anything
did we get a commitment on fentinel no Even Lutnik didn't try to bluff that
He just changed the subject Did we get an agreement on u the theft
of IP no not that I'm aware of
Um and uh are we going to start reselling
them jet engines and ethane which is a necessary part of making plastic I guess
Yes Which is exactly what it used to be
right so uh the um the Wall Street Journal
summarized it as um we just are moving back to where we were but the deal is
leaning a little bit in China's direction now So even our hometown newspaper the Wall
Street Journal is saying that we came out behind
What do you think so I'd love to hear an argument where we came out ahead
on anything on even one thing Nothing on fentinel
nothing Are we coming out ahead because uh or we've got a little bit extra
tariff on them i don't know It's a little uh unclear to me that anything
happened except that China said we're not going to basically not negotiate
anything That's what it looks like Well I had a question uh this week about
the Home Depot deportations So as you know um it's fairly common for
um illegal immigrants to stand near the Home Depot
usually on public property but near the Home Depot and to be available for
Americans to drive up and say "Hey I need somebody to work for a day to help
me dig a ditch or build a wall or something." And then you take a few day
workers with you and you pay them cash and um you're both happy Now
um I didn't understand that because I didn't understand why the Home Depot
workers would be the worst first because were we not promised that the
the order of the deportations would be the the criminals and the worst of them
first And the Home Depot employees not employees but the Home
Depot day workers the illegal ones they would be maybe the opposite
They would be the ones who are trying to work you know trying to claw their way into some kind of a a life but there's
no really indication that they're especially criminal
So why would we reverse from the thing that I've been telling
people you know just calm down don't worry you know we're going to do the worst first and that will we'll
basically never get to the end of the worst So the way I rationalized
that I was okay with very aggressive um deportation is that I didn't think it
was entirely real meaning I'm very much in favor of
getting rid of people who were criminals and the gangs etc But I didn't think
that ICE would have enough resources to ever get to the bottom of that well
So in my view you know those Home Depot people and your your gardener and your
uh your housekeeper if you have a housekeeper um to me they all seem kind of safe
because it would take you know five years to to get rid of the bad people
and then we'd probably have adjusted and we'd say "All right well you know we we
thought we wanted to get rid of everyone but it turns don't you know maybe we're better economically to keep the people
who have jobs and they're paying taxes and they've been good citizens and they've you know they've assimilated
So while I completely understand the argument that says no everybody has to
go back Uh that wasn't the deal That was the deal The deal was there
would be an order to it And that's the deal I signed up for Meaning when I said
you know I support President Trump and I'm in favor of his border policies I
wasn't talking about picking up people at Home Depot So I feel like I got stabbed in the back
because I'm a public figure who has publicly supported very strongly the uh
President Trump's approach to immigration And the worst first was very clearly
a central part of that plan and that is now reversed
So I got screwed by my own side
Do you think I can let that go now I understand the argument Oh but
Scott it's really better to deport everybody who is illegal I understand
your argument but my argument is that's not what I was promised and it's not what I put my face
on and it's not what I backed That's not what I voted for
All right So I feel like I got stabbed in the back by the Trump administration
And I don't know exactly how to turn that off but at the moment I
feel totally screwed because I you know was sort of out front saying "Yeah this
is fine Don't worry about it." But it's not what they promised
Now um so I did a little research on why the change
As far as I can tell the change is because the ICE couldn't get the numbers
that we wanted So if they had focused on the worst first especially in the
context of these sanctuary cities the uh the difficulty in getting enough people
So it looked like uh deportation was even working uh was just too high
because you know you get caught up in the court cases and the protests and you know the cities would fight everything
and that's where all the bad people are you know mostly the the blue cities So I
feel as though there was a political reason that Steven Miller sort of
pressured ICE to go after the less dangerous people It was because of
sanctuary cities Is that your understanding that if sanctuary cities did not exist
that they could do worst first all day long and they would never run out of the worst because they would go to the city
they'd say you know do you have anybody in your jail who's illegal and they'd say oh yeah we got you know five more
this morning And then ICE would say all right we got five more criminals And
they would send them away So here's my request
If if the reason that Home Depot is being targeted and I'm using Home Depot
as a standin for you know just more casual deportations as opposed to going
after hardened criminals Um if that's the reason
then the administration needs to be saying that really loudly you know separately I understand that
you know there's plenty of complaints about sanctuary cities and then separately
there's you know the targeting of the Home Depot noncriminal beyond you know the crime of coming into
the country um you need to tie those together
because if the reason that the Home Depot people are getting scooped up is
that ICE is um you know unable to find anybody in the sanctuary cities then
that needs to be like right right at the top of the messaging It's like that as
long as we're sanctuary cities we can't do worst first
Do do you feel me as long as there are sanctuary cities we
don't have the option of doing the worst first If you tell me that and then I see
that some of the Home Depot people are being deported I'm not going to love it
because it's not worse first but I'm going to at least understand it
And that's better than having a knife in your back and not understanding it
But either way I'm getting by my own side So
let me let me be clear about that I don't like it I I feel like I have been
you know personally personally abused by this process I feel
lied to I feel lied to It's sort of promises made promises not kept
And uh I'm not going to ignore that Not going to ignore that at all Now one of
the things I love about having a Republican audience
is that as we talked about you know the Democrats dislike the Republicans more
than the Republicans dislike the Democrats The Republicans
are willing to uh listen to an argument And so I gave you an argument Some of
you loved it and some of you hated it But you're still willing to to let me
talk right you're you're not hating on me You might
not like that opinion You might disagree with it but that doesn't make us enemies
We're still on the same side right so
you know the the positive message here is that you can have pretty strong
disagreements but as long as you're you know pro America America first and we're we're
sort of all aiming in the right direction but some of us have a difference of how to get there That's
all good That's all fine We're not Democrats right so we're going to talk about
something else in a minute that will be a similar thing where you might not like what I say but it won't make much
difference in terms of the size of my you know my audience or anything else
because you're you allow that which I appreciate a lot
Anyway so I'd love some answers on that question Meanwhile let's uh check out
the photo op competition Um you call them riots
some call them protests but uh apparently there are now 19 states with
200 riders busted in LA So the uh according to the New York Post the uh
the rioting slashprotesting is going to uh Atlanta Chicago and Seattle Hundreds
of protesters here and there thousands of stormed the streets in 35 cities in
19 states blah blah blah But I see it all as a photo op
competition So the the game that's being played is about who can get the best
video or iconic photo that will get burnt into people's minds as the you
know the brand of what happened this summer And so far Trump is winning
because he's done the most clever thing You know if you assume that people who
watch the news are mostly just casual watchers you know maybe 5% of the public
like really digs in and you know figures out the context and knows the numbers
and stuff like that but 95% of the country is just looking at the pictures
And if they see a strong picture and it they see it a lot
then that will change their opinion But what Trump has done cleverly is he sent
in the Marines but they haven't been deployed So I've seen no picture of any
Marines Um secondly he's deployed the National
Guard sort of over the over the complaints of the governors and they've
been um as far as I know they've only been deployed to protect federal
buildings which don't appear to be under any special kind of attack
And then having deployed two branches of the military
with no connection whatsoever to the to the protest like not one of them has
touched a protester or been in a conflict or arrested anybody that
they're all just sort of staying out of the way you know with the
what does Trump do after deploying two two branches of the military
and then having them do basically nothing Now guarding guarding federal buildings
is not nothing but if it causes the protesters to go somewhere else
well then it ends up looking like nothing So there there's no pictures So
you've got zero pictures of of uh Trump's military doing anything you know
bad or uh illegal Somebody's saying that the Home Depot thing is a hoax Um I'm
not gonna read that Andy because while I know the the story about the
individual Home Depot stuff is is not necessarily true I'm
using the Home Depot as a example of people who are not criminals
who might get picked up So it's it's an example It's it's not
based on specific Home Depot situation but let me finish Um so so Trump says
I've been laughing about this all morning He says "If I didn't send in the troops to Los Angeles the last three
nights that once beautiful and great city would be burning to the ground right now
But what exactly did the Marines and the National Guard do in Los Angeles
were they putting out the fires it's sort of perfect He he can claim uh
he can claim success without any visible
without any visible evidence whatsoever And at the same time the pictures that
are being produced are still of you know the the flag waving people in fires So
he's winning he's winning the photo op competition hard but also he's winning
the you know did you respond quickly and with enough vigor to meet the situation
and almost anybody watching would say "Well yeah I mean if you've already you
know pre-deployed the the military two branches but they haven't done anything
dangerous You they they haven't hurt anybody They haven't really gotten involved in the action." Um but they
could they could right
so uh it's sort of perfect for Trump
Anyway the longer it goes the better for Trump Um I saw Chris Cuomo say the news
is sort of the best case scenario for for Trump but I've also seen um
I've seen dueling polls I think it was uh Jessica Tarlov on the
five on Fox News um was saying that some of the uh support for Trump's
immigration policies have plunged But at the same time I've heard there
are polls which say that uh support for Trump's um handling of the the protest/
riiots is uh you know above average In
other words there are more people support it than don't So I think we've got two separate things happening which
is the polls are all over the place I think it depends what they ask and how they ask and exactly when they asked it
But uh in the end I think that uh as long as Trump's military doesn't hurt
anybody or do anything ridiculous um I think Trump wins in the end
Yeah All right uh FBI director Cash Patel
um he told uh just the news that they're going to investigate the people behind
um the protests So the people behind it would be the money people So FBI will
look at the money trail Um I don't know that that means that any of them are
breaking the law necessarily depending on what they're doing or
funding but uh Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona he wants to see those
activist organizations um who are committing crimes
um have them investigated and criminally prosecuted But again I don't know
exactly what the crime would be because is it illegal
to organize a protest and fund it um because they would not be the people
who were throwing the rocks But if you funded people that you know
1% of them might throw rocks have you broken the law i don't know But if they
have broken the law of course something needs to be done
All right let's talk about the flag burning Uh whenever this comes up I like
to add my opinion to it Um Thomas Massie posted on X He said "Burning your own
American flag is narded." So he's you know I guess intentionally misspelling
 Uh but it's not illegal nor should it be
He says "No one should want a federal government so powerful that it can lock you up for a year for burning your own
stuff." Now remember that Trump is in favor of uh jail for burning a flag but
Thomas Massie is not He goes "Thankfully your constitution prohibits Congress from making such stupid laws." All right
So I posted my opinion on this You've heard it before but I'll put it in different words this time So one reason
I respect the American flag and it's just one reason that I respect
the American flag is that it gets stronger when protesters burn it
And that's a feature not a bug It gets stronger when you burn it Now that's the
kind of flag I want I don't want any weak wimpy flag that if you burn it
if somehow has destroyed the country or weakened the country No No Um and
then I want you to know that like most of you I'm also offended when I see an American flag being burned
like you I can feel it you know like a a person who loves their country I just
feel it like "Oh god are you burning my flag right in front of me?"
So I feel it but that feeling is also when I most vividly feel the power of
the flag And I like having a flag that can make me feel something and can make me feel
the power of the country that it represents So for my for my money
um if you've got a wimpy stupid flag you can burn and it's causes so much trouble
that somebody thinks they need to lock you up for it that is a inadequate flag
I want a flag that you can burn right in front of the Supreme Court and the
Supreme Court will say "There you go free speech." And that's it
And then the more you burn it the more it reminds people that America is a
place where you get to have unpleasant opinions and you can express them in
public And you can do it all day long
And the And what happens is the country doesn't get weaker
It just reminds us every day that we've got this uh flag that
gets stronger when you try to burn it So that's that's my take That's my reframe
Uh meanwhile uh exABC News correspondent Terry Moran that poor bastard who's
having the worst month of anybody ever So he gets put on leave and then he gets
fired from ABC for having some you know uh hard to explain uh bad opinions about
uh Steven Miller and Trump I guess he has announced on a video that he's going
to be a Substack blogger but not right away because it's going to take some
time for him to figure it out And I thought to myself
um that's sort of embarrassing after 28
years doing a job for ABC News and then you get fired and you're announcing
you're a Substack blogger That's not going to work for a lot of people but good luck
Um meanwhile the uh publication called futurism is talking about a college
let's see what it is Ohio State so Ohio State University has just announced uh
that starting this fall every single one of its students will be forced to use AI
in class So instead of banning AI
you know because it's a way that students can cut corners or you know potentially cheat um they're going the
other direction and they're saying that it's a requirement that you know how to use AI and that you know how to use it
in every single class Now what do you think of that
do you think the colleges should ban AI because then you don't learn the same or
should it encourage people to become experts in not only the class but how to
use AI within that domain Uh I'm going to go hard in favor of Ohio
State I think this might be one of the smartest things I've seen because in the
real world everybody's going to use AI for everything And every one of their subjects from
math to biology to history there's going to be an AI tool that
helps them understand it Now I've used Grock
almost every day for I don't know months And when I use Grock I get some context
that I didn't know And I usually remember it
But it's easier it's way easier to look it up with AI than it is to you know Google things and look at every source
Um so I feel in my own experience that AI makes me smarter faster than any
technology I've ever been associated with Now I don't forget the things I look up
on AI and it's not like I could just take its writing and you know read it to
you on this podcast I have to understand it and then I put it in my own words and
that's the only model that works If I if I were to just read a script that AI
wrote or Grock wrote you would know it was a script and you wouldn't you wouldn't love it
So I'm I I think this is a very uh
uh what would I call it forwardthinking and aware Uh Ohio State University has at least
one person there who is very smart and understands you know what's coming So
yeah I think all the colleges should adapt to AI or maybe we should get rid
of colleges and just use AI That's coming Well let's talk about our nuclear
power policy Um apparently according to
um I didn't see where the source was but
uh China plans to build 100 new uh nuclear power plants in the next 10
years So 10 nuclear power plants per year for 10 years till they have 100 of
them The US uh has built only three power plants since 1995
And I can't name them I I didn't know we even built three
since 1995 I thought it was zero but all right I guess there are three Um so
we're way behind but the good news and a real test of the
Adams uh the the Adam's law of slowmoving
disasters Now the Adams law of slowmoving disasters
says that if we all recognize the problem coming uh we got lots of time
We're really good at dealing with the problem And the problem coming is that AI is going to use way more electricity
than we have If we don't do the best in AI we'll fall behind militarily
economically and every other way to China and maybe other countries So
really we really understand the the risk and we see it coming and we kind of
agree what the problem is and we also agree on the solution which is if you
don't make nuclear work and fast there's probably not a second way to you know
handle all the electrical needs I think Elon Musk would say you could get there
with solar panels and batteries but uh probably we need all of it
So um the good news according to The Hill is that uh Trump has proposed
getting rid of all climate rules for power plants So that there will be any
kind of power plant But uh a lot of the rules were really allegedly not really
helping the uh the atmosphere or anything else The the rules were mostly
you know don't pollute and don't add this or that to the atmosphere
But apparently those rules might have been overdone So those might get rolled back That
would make a big difference And apparently we've opened we the United
States a uranium enrichment facility in Oakidge Tennessee
Um because it turns out that we currently import 99% of our US nuclear
fuel What when did that happen
when did we get to the point um Scott you were falling for the Home
Depot hoax Now did you hear me explain that when I talk about Home Depot I'm
not talking about a specific Home Depot and any specific thing happening at Home
Depot I'm using it as a general holder
for noncriminal immigrants who were being picked up Now are you arguing that
no noncriminals are being picked up because otherwise you're just being an
 all right So I accept that the stories the
specific stories about the Home Depot um are not representative of anything
So we're both on the same page right whatever story there is about any
specific Home Depot or even more than one has nothing to do with my opinion
Everybody everybody understand that i use it just as a you know like a holding
place basically to talk about people who are not criminals
All right you got that can you handle that
all right It's not an analogy
Oh god So I'm going to have to block you
All right Um so most of our uh uranium enrichment
comes from places like uh Russia
not exactly the best source for uranium enrichment Uh Canada okay Australia
Kazakhstan and use use Beckistan anyway But uh apparently we've got some
sanctions on the Russian stuff but you can you can get around it So at least we're doing all the right
things at least on paper to get our nuclear facility going
Anyway the uh Hungarian government um has apparently they're going to
release a documentary they made exposing the US uh aid scandal That's what they
call according to the the British Patriot is retweeting this on or
reposting it Now apparently this is something we've known since April but uh
it's getting more attention just cuz somebody's posting it around Um
apparently uh the film is going to highlight how millions of dollars have been directed towards supporting
left-wing political movements in Hungary You know at this point I don't know that
the Hungarian documentary will tell us anything we didn't know Um
but uh it might be for people who are not following you know Mike Benz If you
follow Mike Benz this will probably look like your repeat but if you don't you
might find out some stuff you didn't know But watch out for the documentary effect which makes everything look
persuasive All right Um
according to the register uh DARPA is testing a device the
soldiers can swallow to make them less stressed So
apparently it would be an electronic device It wouldn't be a chemical And the
electronics that were in the let's say pill form that you swallow would uh
somehow interact with your your gut and would make you less um less stressed
because it would affect your gut Now remember I tell you that uh your
brain and your body are the same tool Well here you go there Here's a perfect
example If you could control your gut environment it would change how your
brain is processing your experience Now that's a that's a really good
example of your brain and your body being the same tool right there So
anyway that's just uh they're just getting ready to study the possibilities here So it's not like it's close to
being a product Um maybe they should just skip the robots but I guess they want to make
super soldiers first I don't know how long it will be before robots are doing all the fighting but in
the short run in the short run it looks like we'll have some you know super soldiers
In other news the new outlet says that uh they figured out how to grow a new
tooth uh to replace one that fell out or was removed Now this would be different than
an implant So implants have existed for a long time but instead of an implant it
would be an actual um an actual tooth that would not be organic by itself but
apparently would merge with your organic mouth and it would grow nerves and and
act like a real tooth That's kind of amazing
Who's doing that um I don't know somebody's doing that
and then I talk about this a lot but when it gets uh when it's done by MIT it
feels like uh it's closer to reality So MIT has a windowsized
device that turns uh that turns air into drinking water with no power source So
you don't have to plug it in You just put it there and it sucks uh moisture
out of the air even in the desert and creates water And if you had a rack of
them you know more than one of these windowsized things you could have enough of water for your entire family
Now um I've talked about this technology before but apparently the other ones
have some issues or they create water that's a little too salty So there's
some other issues but apparently the MIT version has uh solved those problems
Now it makes me ask this question what keeps us from living on the sea
you know what what is preventing us from living on
basically you know floating gigantic boats that just stay at the sea all the
time And uh the answer is quite a bit
but we're getting closer and closer to a time when you could live on the ocean
All right let me tell you my design for ocean living
Uh there should be a special barge So basically I would imagine a
an island that's created by a number of barges that you could connect together
So you could walk from one to the other but also that each of them would be
built so it could be part of the navigation So in other words if your island of
boats needed to avoid a typhoon you could just relocate Um now in many
cases you wouldn't need to relocate it at all but maybe in most cases you would
because you'd want your weather to be perfect So I imagine a bunch of barges that
could somewhat easily be connected and then disconnected You would want your
utility barges to be on the outer perimeter So if there's a problem with
one you could move to another For example one of your barges could be a
garbage barge But the garbage barge would need to float away and you know dispose of its
garbage in a appropriate way But during that time maybe a replacement garbage
barge can connect Uh likewise you'd want an indoor you'd
want some kind of a garden barge maybe indoor Um so that you could grow
vegetables Then you might have a fake uh fish
growing barge or maybe a fishing barge Imagine a barge that's optimized with
robots to just fish and they they can tell like they caught a fish and they
can prepare it and you can eat all kinds of fish all day So that'd be cool if
your AI and your robot were doing all the work And what about uh let's see
what else would you need yeah you'd also need a self sailing ship So we would
need would need to figure out using AI probably how to sail to the you know the
best weather and the you know in just in time etc So
here's what I think yeah your biggest problem would be pirate ships
Sergio says you're right Your biggest problem would be security So you'd
probably need some kind of a security arrangement with a established
country like the United States But imagine if you will
u a city that's built on barges that are connected together and only the outer
ring is the utility ones that that might need to be replaced or there might need
some maintenance etc Um I think it'd be pretty cool I think it's coming It's
coming All right ladies and gentlemen that concludes my comments for the day
Thanks for joining Hope you're not too angry at me And uh hurricanes no problem
Well they wouldn't be a problem because we can see them coming but also you
could relocate where they rarely if ever happen So yeah as long as you can relocate
you're in pretty good shape Tsunamis
it's a good question You could probably find a place where there's
never been a recorded tsunami Um
so there's that All right Uh I'm going to say a few
words privately to the people on locals the rest of you Thanks for joining I
will see you same time tomorrow same place and and
