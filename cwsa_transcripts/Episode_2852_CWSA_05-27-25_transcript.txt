let's look at our stocks holy cow stocks are
up look at that wow all right so that's the good news
let's open our comments and get you the show that you deserve damn it you deserve it
[Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's called Coffee with Scott Adams and
you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take this experience up to levels that nobody can even understand
with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a cuper
mug or a glass a tanker shell or stein a canteen jugger flask a vessel of any
kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and join me now
for for the best part of your day the simultaneous sip and it's happening now
go so good all right well let's see if there's
any science about coffee oh yes there is some new
research according to Scypost and Eric Nolan shows that decaf coffee can it can
not always but it can mimic caffeine's effect in habitual drinkers in other
words if you have decaf your body might register it a lot
like caffeinated coffee now do you know who knew that before the
science pavlov that's basically Pavlov's dog
right so Pavlov was training his dog
dogs and I give them a treat after he rang the bell and then eventually he
could just ring the bell and they would salivate well that's what this is that's what CAF decaf is decaf is just ringing
the bell without the actual caffeine as the uh as the payoff i'm pretty sure any
hypnotist would have known that not every time and not for every person that it's not going to it's
not going to fix your uh caffeine headache if you haven't had real caffeine but then every once in a while
you can have decaf and it gives you the same little kick as if you had the real
thing and even if you know it doesn't make any difference if you know that you're getting decaf i have used this
trick on myself many times where I would give myself decaf
because I had too much caffeinated stuff that day and sure enough I would feel as
though I was getting a little boost so there's a little trick for you according to the Washington Times uh
Trump is no longer interested or at least he's not exhibiting interest in uh
going to Fort Knox to find out if the gold is still there do you remember when
uh Elon Musk and Trump were both saying "Maybe we should check to see if that
gold is still in for Knox." Well that interest seems to have waned because
nobody cares about it anymore and uh the reason given is that apparently it gets
audited on some kind of a regular basis so they do know that the gold is there
to which I say h that's one
possibility one possibility is that they know for sure the gold is there what's
the other possibility that they know for sure the gold is not
there so if you want to keep your suspicions
alive go ahead keep your suspicions alive although probably it's all
there well over in China they've developed a uh a giant uh salmon farming
ship so that they can raise salmon inside the ship like a basically like a
fish farm and it's better than using a regular fish farm which would be in one
place and maybe a typhoon would get it or there's some other kind of problem
that can destroy your your fish but if you put it in a big old ship I guess you
have access to all the water you need and you can bake yourself some
salmon so I like that idea salmon farm in a
ship some say it's going to be crappy salmon because they would feed it
substandard food but they don't have to i mean you know the possibility is they
could feed it good food and then your salmon would be fine but we'll see if that that becomes
a thing according to the University of Cologne which I can smell from here
uh parents this this will surprise absolutely nobody um can you believe it parents are
not happier but have a greater sense of meaning in life according to a study now
how many of you didn't know that if you've ever seen any parent trying to
get their kids to school or get them to do their homework or get them to do anything they don't look like they're
super happy but if you were to ask them "Are you glad you had kids?" Well nearly 100%
would say "Yeah it's the best thing I've ever done you should do it too." So yes
having children is not about having a bunch of laughs it's about a greater
sense of meaning in life i feel like every parent already knew that is there
anyone who doesn't know that probably the most well-known and understood phenomenon in all the world
well the UAE United Arab uh what's the E united Arab
uh E anyway the UAE uh is giving every single resident free
chat GPT plus the good stuff for every
resident uh I saw this on Mario post on X News9
is a source and it's the only country doing that and it's part of their uh part of
their push to be the the high-tech um sort of hub of the world that's
pretty good um so everybody will have chat GPT in UAE i wonder if any other country
will follow that model did you hear the story you may have heard the story about the uh open AI
this is also Chad GBT uh one of their models uh allegedly disobeyed the human
instructions and tried to sabotage the the shutdown mechanism did you see that
story well it did not surprise me to find out that there's a report today that that
was not the regular chat GPT in a regular setting but rather they were
doing safety testing so they were it was an artificial condition safety testing it
it wasn't something that could have happened in the real world so probably that's not really something you need to
worry about um and I don't see how it could possibly change its own code
or Yeah there there was something about that story that sounded a little sketchy
yeah Owen knew it owen was all over that that it just didn't sound true did it so
I I was pausing on that story a little bit um but I if I mention it I shouldn't
should not have well Kamla Harris was over in Australia giving a speech at a
big event there and uh the clips from it are
hilarious because she was in full word salad Kamla Harris mode and
honestly I couldn't tell if she was drunk or stupid a lot of people said "Well
probably both." She does look drunk and stupid but is it
possible is it possible she's just stupid like really really stupid because
I'm giving her the benefit of a doubt that she's drunk but my god is she
embarrassing oh my god and she could have been our president every time you
see her talk you think to yourself "Oh my god
she she was within striking distance of being the the president of the United
States." Wow um speaking of other losers
uh Mayor Karen Bass of uh LA she posted on X that
uh that homes are under construction throughout the Palisades ahead of
expectations and then there was a little uh video from above of a house being
built and I said to myself "Huh this is kind of strange if you're
claim that houses plural are being built
don't you think that your evidence would be more than one house?" that doesn't that strike you as
odd if you were trying to say "Yeah a lot of houses are being built." Wouldn't
you show more than one and then I look at the
comments apparently it's one house exactly one house no I don't know
if it's one house but she's definitely full of uh there there are some
things happening and there are some action and there are some things moving in the right direction but if you were
to drive there it might not look like anything's happening anyway she says they've uh
taken action to cut the red tape and expedite the permits but uh she's going
to get uh destroyed in the comments to that all right good luck there Mayor Karen
Bass um did you know that uh according
to the Daily Wire the Treasury officials in the US uh are doing a good job of
choking off the cash flow to the cartels so they're figuring out what
money flowing through the US is cartel money and they're shutting it down and
sanctioning it and uh making sure that individuals are not getting it and I
said to myself wait a minute are you telling me that we always had the
ability to know what was the cartel's cash and it took until Trump's second
administration to start shutting it down wait
what how is that a little bit fishy
it does seem to me like Trump is the first person who's taken anything serious about Mexico or the
border ju just hold that in your head that the
Treasury had the ability to identify the cartel's money flow and we were not
messing with it how in the world is that even possible that we weren't doing
anything about it until now the the only thing I can imagine is that
we were complicit and something about the Trump administration has decided not
to be complicit i don't know there's something
there's something to be learned by that story but uh whatever it is it's not
good but it's probably good now anyway uh there's a story in the New
York Times that is just full of anonymous sources oh man they got some anonymous
sources and uh I saw Greta Gretan Sustern was mocking them for their
anonymous sources but the story is that uh Trump is backing away from sanctions
on Russia because he wants to do business deals with them meaning America
wants to do business deals with them now do you think that's true and and all they have are anonymous
sources what what have I taught you about anonymous
sources anonymous sources have basically
no news value because they're they're usually made up so it doesn't matter if it's the
New York Times if it's full of anonymous sources i don't know about
that but um it does seem that Germany
France this is another related news of news so that I saw this on Mario's posts
uh the source is CGTN whatever that is but it says that Germany France and
the UK and the US have given Ukraine the green light to fire missiles with no
range cap in other words go ahead Ukraine and just start lighting up
Russia itself uh that means that Ukraine will be
striking targets deep inside Russia
uh do you think that's first of all true i don't know if it's true because it's
not coming from a news source I've ever heard of um but probably it's
true i mean it feels maybe it's a little too on the nose but it feels like the
only thing that Europe could come up with is all right if uh Moscow and and
Russia are you know cranking it up and they're not talking about peace let's
just start sending missiles into the heart of Russia what could go wrong well
a lot could go wrong but uh it kind of makes sense that they might loosen up
the the distance cap so I guess we'll have to watch and see if Russia gets lit
up with these new uh missiles and if it makes any difference at all or does it
make Russia just twice as aggressive so we're going to find out
now what do you think is true do you think that there there are two stories
about Putin right now one is that he felt under attack by NATO
and that really he's acting in a semi-defensive way by making sure that
NATO doesn't surround him and that uh Ukraine had always been the red line and
we cross the red line so you got to expect it
the other version of Putin is that he plans to dominate all of Europe and this
is just one more step in doing that now they can't both be true right
it can't be true that he's he's defensively attacking Ukraine but he's
also looking to roll over and control all of Europe
or uh CGTN is China's state TV somebody says is that
true well that would make a difference wouldn't it yeah so I guess um I guess the best
take about the anything about Ukraine is that uh we
can't tell what's true so that I guess that's where I'll settle on this we just don't know what's
true but we'll see if any missiles are going into the heart of uh
Russia well uh Jake Tapper was on Pierce Morgan and he's still talking about his
new book that uh talks about uh Joe Biden's mental decline and apparently
Jake Tapper has admitted that the Democrat cover up of Biden's cognitive
decline might be it might be worse than Watergate i guess in his book he said it
wasn't worse than Watergate but now he's willing to admit yeah it might be might
be worse than Watergate what do you think is the cover
up of Biden worse than Watergate yes yes by a
mile it's not even close and not only that but the Democrats have done lots of
things that are worse than Watergate it's not like the first thing that's worse than Watergate but when I think of
Watergate it just seems so tame like imagine if the worst thing that was
happening in the United States was Watergate if that were the worst thing
happening I'd be pretty darn happy stocks would be up everything would be
good um here's uh something I want to add to
the whole uh Biden brain cover up
now most of you are probably under the opinion that everybody in the news business were completely aware that
Biden's brain wasn't working but they were just pretending they didn't
know i'm going to modify that a little bit i don't think that's totally true
and here's why have you ever seen the psychology experiments where uh they'll have a
bunch of a small group of people and they'll be asked to look at something
and say let's say what line is longer than another line or just some basic
factual thing and only one person will be an actual
subject of the experiment and all the rest will be participants who know that they're
participants and they're lying and what happens is you can
somewhat easily make the person who is the real subject believe whatever the
other people all believe is true so it's so easy to change a person's
perception until they don't see something or they do see something that
just isn't there now this is a very repeatable experiment in psychology and you've
probably seen it a million times in in the real world so here's my
take for sure no doubt about it there were people in the the business the news
business sorry I gotta make an adjustment there uh for
sure there were people in the news business who were aware that uh Biden's brain wasn't working and that it was a
big problem there's no doubt about it i don't know if Jake Tapper was one but
maybe you know maybe but if you have enough people who were
pretending that he's perfectly fine and there certainly were enough
people pretending that then you can guarantee that some some number of
people were just sort of hypnotized into believing it was true because when they
looked at the other people they weren't seeing anything that's a problem
so my guess is that it's that it was always a combination it was a combination of
people who knew they were lying and just were trying to prevent Hitler from
coming into office you know in their view uh some people who just preferred
the Democrats to win you know that would be the Democrats and some people
who had the ability to know but that ability was sort of shut
off by the fact they were put in an environment where it seemed like nobody else
noticed in theory they would be cognitively blinded
to the obvious so I think that I think you have to be a little bit careful
about assuming that every single person was aware and knew it because you
could see it because if you were if you were not a if you were not in that
environment then you would not have been influenced by it and you could just see it clearly right if if your experience
was turning on my podcast every morning and listening to me say since
maybe 2017 or something like that saying "No Biden's brain is completely broken
he's obviously incompetent." If you were listening to me say it every day you
would be completely immune from the cognitive blindness
because you would have at least one person and probably lots more who are telling you the truth so you wouldn't
have that problem but when you look at the Democrats they would definitely have that
problem of being cognitively blinded by their own team who were lying
basically well um were there other examples where they were cognitively
blinded yes what about the fine people hoax do you think every single person
um on the you know the mainstream media do you think every one of them thought that the fine people hoax was
real no no there there were
undoubtedly smart influential people who knew somewhat early on that that wasn't
true but they had an interest in acting like it was true now again take an
innocent Democrat and put him in that situation where all these important people are
pretending they're lying but they're pretending that the fine people hoax was
true same problem they they would come to believe it was true because all these
important influential people said it was true same with uh Elon Musk's Nazi
salute which was of course not a Nazi salute do you think it was even possible
that people with normal brains thought that was a Nazi salute well if you have enough people
who are the credible people the ones you trust and they all seem to say it was
which was the case now they were all liars probably the people who you know the the
prominent ones probably just a bunch of liars who didn't want uh you know Trump
and Elon to have power but I'll bet you I'll bet you some large percentage of
Democrats who would have been perfectly capable of knowing that certainly wasn't a Nazi salute i mean you would have an
IQ of 80 and you knew that wasn't really a Nazi salute but you would have been
cognitively blinded by your own side because they kept saying it was so if
everybody you talk to says it was well suddenly you start thinking "No maybe
I'm wrong maybe it was." Right so it wouldn't even be unusual that people
were cognitively blinded about Biden's brain it would be the normal operating
system of just how everything works as long as as long as the people in
charge were lying in the same way then the people who weren't powerful
and were just sort of on the same team would uh believe it was true and they
would believe it easily even though it was obviously not true well here's one of my favorite
stories speaking of Jake Tapper he was on the Scott Galloway's podcast and he
was talking about his son i guess he's got a 15-year-old son and he was talking
about in the context of the Democrat party and the Democrat
messaging so he talks about his son was uh you know a football player and he
wanted to grow up and be a cop so he's 15 and that's his goal and apparently uh
because he wanted to be a cop the people around him his friends have decided he
must be a racist and what he wants to be a cop because he
think he thinks that's the best way to help people and therefore his friends
think he's a racist cuz he wants to be a cop and so Jake Tapper is saying quote
"You're deciding he's a racist because he wants to be a cop." And why does he
want to be a cop he wants to be a cop because he wants to help people you know and he thinks that's the best way he can
help people and that's how the Democratic Party talks to men not just
white men but men and then Jake goes on
he says the idea that he wants to be a policeman and therefore he's racist my
son and like you know that was the big laugh and then I got dragged in the
comments and all that stuff and I thought to myself this is why you
 are losing elections so does Jake Tapper understand what's
wrong with the Democrat party yep now I can't name names but I'm going to
tell you that there's at least one other person who's who's a big name in the
media business who had the same um enlightened
response meaning that it's one thing to support the Democrats until you have a
son and then it becomes impossible if you have a white son
so he's the second person I know of who had a white son and he realized "Holy
 the Democrats are against my own
son." So I I I think that uh Jake is actually
kind of brave to say this out loud and uh it's
important so you know whatever you think of his other opinions and what he should
have known and what he should have said sooner and those are all fair fair uh
criticisms does he now understand does he
understand what the problem is yes yes he does very clearly because
when it comes home like that you're not talking about the news if you're talking about your
son and the the trouble he's going to have in
society that that's some reality coming home so there's that but let's see are
the Democrats planning to do anything about this problem well turns out yes
yeah the Democrats have a plan according according to the New York
Times th this is going to sound like I'm making it up so I'm going to tell you in
advance i'm not making this next part up this is actually
real according to the New York Times the the Democrats are going to spend $20
million on a project they call quote speaking with American men a strategic
plan uh they will they will quote study the syntax language and content that
gains attention and vitality in these spaces above all we must shift from a
moralizing [Laughter]
tone are you getting close no no could Could the Democratic Party
spend about one minute talking to  Jake Tapper to find out what the problem is hey Jake could you please
could you please explain to these  idiots what the problem is and
if you're not going to I refer you to Fisher King which is a account on Acts
that you should be following by the way fisher King f i s h e r king and uh he
commented on this he says "If Democrats want to win over young men particularly white men they
need to stop actively hating them." Okay okay now we're getting
closer was it a problem with the syntax in their spaces or is it that they're
actively hating them whi- Which one do you think is the problem here
because we need to they need to stop actively hating them demeaning them yes
and putting up roadblocks such as affirmative action DEI sensitivity training in the path of their success
it's not about quote the tone and then Fischer King follows up by
saying he says of course this will not happen anytime soon because the coalition they've assembled won't have
it they're like the bar scene in Star Wars
now compare that level that level of analysis which is of course is perfect
to uh we're going to spend $20 million to study the syntax language and content
that gains attention and vitality in these spaces well why don't you give the $20
million to Fisher King because he just solved your whole problem you but you're going to ignore it because
you're the bar scene from Star Wars all right
now is the problem that is the problem that politicians are uniquely unable to
understand the public is that the problem do you think it's just that politicians are not good at
understanding things well here here's a story from today about Trump so I'm I'm
just going to read one thing that Trump is saying and you tell me who understands the public right trump uh
does a truth and he says uh that he's considering pulling $3 billion from
Harvard and giving it to trade schools across the
[Applause] country any questions
trump wants to pull $3 billion of taxpayer money from Harvard which is a
cesspool of discrimination and put it in trade
schools which would be really good for men other other people
too now is there anything to is there anything you don't understand about that
no you understand that perfectly is it right on point with what that entire
demographic is looking for and wants yes yes it is it's right on point does it
treat them like children no does it treat them like people who want to contribute and make a difference and be
successful in life yes it gets everything right it's not a problem with
politicians it's a problem with politicians who can't do this
all right I think I made my point i've been following uh on X uh
Matt Van Swall who's uh doing a great job of talking about the Doge
situation um here he summarizes it this way doge is literally one of the most
popular government initiatives in history 73% of Americans say they
support cutting government waste trump brought in the smartest man on earth to
do it and then the left destroyed Elon for it and the GOP won't vote on
it i can't believe this and then Elon responded to the
post three words did my
best wow there there's almost nothing I can say
about that you know you you probably heard me early on in the Doge process and I was
saying you know I love everything Doge is trying to do but when it gets to
Congress they're just going to spend his savings but it's even worse than that
they're not they're never going to even codify the savings not the Democrats not the Republicans they're
not even going to vote on it so all that work all that
sacrifice that uh Elon Musk did to get that
right Congress is going to on it
and I I'm almost losing my mind that we can just watch this happen
now it's not everybody you know Marjorie Taylor Green is trying to get it
codified etc but the fact that all that
effort it looks like you know some portion of it anyway is going to be
thwarted by your own Congress is such a It's such a
tragedy it's almost It's almost impossible to understand it's like we're
running as fast as we can toward a cliff and we even have the smartest
people in the world trying to prevent it and even that doesn't
help what is going on here what is going on
well in other news do you ever have one of these situations where there's
something that you just assumed was always true and then suddenly one day
you realize or you hear something and you go "Wait a minute that couldn't have been
true." So here's an example of that for me so for years and years and years I've
been hearing that one of the reasons that Harvard and some of the other Ivy Leagues have a lot of foreign students
is what do you know the answer why is it that Harvard and a lot of other Ivy
Leagues have um a high percentage of foreign students you know the answer too right
everybody knows the answer the answer is that the foreign students were paying
full price full tuition and uh so they'd make more money
over the foreign students right just obvious now you know as I I tell you too
often I've got a I have a degree in economics and I've got an MBA from a top
school and I would hear that and I'd say to myself "Oh okay well that explains
everything." And then one day which was just recently I just realized what an
idiot I am so here's the assumption you have to
make for this to be true are you ready for this
if he also believed that was true here's the assumption that you and I both made
we made the assumption that if these foreign students didn't come in and pay full tuition that the seats would be
[Laughter] empty that the seats would be
empty because because they wouldn't be able to find a bunch of uh Asian-American people who desperately
wanted to go to Harvard but got turned away because they were Asian-American or that all the white
students who knew exactly what Harvard cost and they were applying but they got
turned away because they were white that they wouldn't fill those
spaces it you know obviously they might have needed you know some financial support
etc but it couldn't have possibly been true it couldn't possibly have been true that
Harvard would lose money if they said "Well you know the rest of these seats have to be full tuition." And they
couldn't find enough Americans who had a 4.5 average and and had participated in
every possible you know thing that you need that that wouldn't be willing to pay whatever it took to get a Harvard
degree i I' I've been laughing at myself for a
few days what an idiot what a freaking idiot I was why did I ever imagine that
was true now the actual truth I think is a little deeper i don't know what it is
actually but some people said that the foreign students parents were maybe
making large donations i don't know how you know how universal that was
other people said "No no it's the the real game here is to educate foreign
people who have become leaders in their own country so really it's how the US
government controls other countries in the long term by educating them in
Harvard." To which I say really sending them to the the heart of
communism the heart of communism and then sending him home with a Harvard degree is going to help America somehow
that doesn't really track then other people were saying Scott the uh the foreign students were
also getting uh discounted tuition to which I say "What
what now now I'm really confused." Um so I don't know exactly what's
true i just know that I was a freaking idiot an idiot for imagining that those
Harvard seats were going to sit there empty because we didn't fill them with foreign students paying full tuition
is anybody having the same reaction that I had when I first thought of it is anybody saying
"Oh I just sort of assumed that was true i didn't really think about it that much." No it couldn't have been true it
never could have been true i don't know what is true but it's definitely not
that anyway is there any other news about
Harvard that makes Harvard look stupid oh [Laughter]
yeah again again I have to tell you before I tell you this story I'm not
making it up this is an actual story in the news according to the Daily Mail
Harvard uh just fired a professor after finding that she fabricated research
used in studies on dishonesty so Francesca Gino she was considered a
star business professor at Harvard and she'd been doing uh I guess she'd been
doing studies you know more than one study i guess there were at least four studies she did about honesty and she
she had allegedly [Laughter] falsified she lied she lied on her
studies about lying oh my god and she was like a star
professor oh my god i I swear I didn't make that
up well Dan Bonino is giving us a little update on X about uh what's going on
there and he said uh that he made the decision to either reopen or push
additional resources into investigating uh three specific cases he mentioned
number one the DC pipe bombing investigation you know how it seemed
like nothing was happening with that DC you know that was the January 6 who put the pipe bomb there because that all
looked really suspicious so that's good I'm glad that he's putting some resources is behind that the next one is
the cocaine discovery at the White House really
Dan how many of you give a a  about the cocaine discovery at the
White House how many years ago does anybody care about that is that where
you want your your tax money to be spent do you want the uh FBI to go look into
the who who left the bag of
cocaine i have so little interest in that now I assume that's purely
political and I don't mind that political stuff gets done but why are
you wasting our money on a bag of cocaine even in the White House
so Dan why in the world are you spending time and money on that like what could
come of it like what what's the upside is the upside that we get one person in
trouble for some drugs what is the
upside now I understand the upside of looking into that DC pipe bombing and
that's a pretty big upside because we could find out something that really matters and and I think the country
cares but really the bag of cocaine just because it was a big headline story how
about no h how about you just don't waste my money on that it's bad enough that the
the Congress is not going to vote on Doge but you're gonna you're gonna
consciously waste my money on that one bag of cocaine that somebody left god I
could not be less interested in that uh and the other one is the leak of
the Supreme Court DOS case well I think they do need to understand
where the leaks come from but I don't know if they can find it
anyway I saw a comment on X from retired uh Colonel Doug
McGregor now it means more because he's a retired combat um
professional and he said this about uh about peace in Ukraine he said "In
all honesty I do not believe there's a chance for a deal with Russia and Ukraine at this point." He says "If
you're Zilinski the worst thing that could happen to you is for troops to come
home." You know where this is going he says they are likely to find him and kill him if he ends the war he's the
target the lives lost on the battlefield exceed one million and the wounded are
one to one and a half to two times that number now does that opinion sound
familiar that that's my opinion my opinion is if Zilinski entered the war
he would personally be killed so that we don't have any option for peace as long as he's in
power so um and it makes a it makes a
difference when I hear from uh Colonel McGregor
because you know he's got a deeper understanding of how the the troops would feel in a case like that but uh I
agree [Music] absolutely um I have a correction to
make uh I don't know the exact uh details but uh I think my part of it was
wrong um I told you about Gaza and uh I told you that the US
contractors were going to handle the uh the the aid and the food for the Gaza
residents were being uh relocated into one quarter of Gaza so that the rest of
it could be cleared of Hamas I guess and uh I mistakenly said that the US was
paying for that foreign aid um I think it's only true that US
contractors are managing the aid but probably being paid to do it that makes
them contractors um but it doesn't look like America necessarily was paying for
the aid i don't know who is well I saw
Zubie on the X platform talking about uh some statistics about single moms and he
noted that the USA has the highest rate of children living in single mother households we're about triple the global
average so 23% of uh USA households have a single
mom and Zubie asks "Why do you think that is
does anybody have an idea why do why do you think that the US has the highest
rate of children living in single mother households and the answer is because
it's an option that's it that that's the whole reason if it's
an option people will take it and the better the option is the more likely
they'll take it now in in my own example
um I have twice married single moms who had
stepkids now do you think that that happens as easily in other countries do
you think that in every country in the world a single mom with two kids can
easily get married or remarried probably not
probably there are huge cultural disadvantages do you think that
it would be easy for a mom to get divorced in every other
country probably not uh do you think that the woman has maybe a job that pays
um whether you know before she gets divorced well not in every country but
in the US a little bit more likely so there there's a whole
different story in the black community in the US where the rate is even higher it's like 50% and I'm not going to
pretend I know what the dynamics are there but maybe has something to do with government support you know maybe
there's just a little bit bit more government support going on
but generally speaking uh things happen because there's incentives or because there are options
or because it's possible that's it it if we were in a
country where getting divorced was sort of the end of your life it just wouldn't
happen as much but we live in a country where people make it work i mean it's
not easy but they make it work they they have possibilities they have options so if
their husband is uh you know drinking or not getting it done one way or the other
they have options so I I don't think it goes I think the there's no mystery to it
whatsoever in uh science
news surgeons are apparently getting some kind of special glasses
that can look at medications and it will tell them if it's a big mistake to give
this medication to this specific patient um so we're talking about uh
literally picking the wrong stuff or something that maybe doesn't work with some other
stuff and it doesn't store the data so it's not doing anything privacy-wise but
basically if they pick up the medication the glasses will look at it and it will
tell them "Oh don't use that stuff." So they're still waiting on uh
FDA approval but u the technology has been tested and it works nbc News is
reporting on that all right ladies and gentlemen that are
the stories that that are Yeah those are the stories uh for today that are worthy
of your time uh thanks for joining and uh did you did you all see
the video of uh French President Mcronone's wife pushing him in the face
on the before he exited the airplane in Vietnam i'm still waiting to figure out what
that was all about but on the other hand it's sort of none of our business
because whatever that was it was personal you know it wasn't a state state issue but it was
funny i guess that's my only comment about it it was kind of funny we don't know anything else about it all right
that's all I got for now i'm going to talk to the people on locals privately um the rest of you I'll see you tomorrow
thanks for joining locals i'm coming at you privately in 30 seconds
