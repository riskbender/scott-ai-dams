sorry I'm late just a few seconds nothing you even notice well let's get
my locals people on here make sure I can see their
comments and then then we got a
show there it is looking good
good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's
called Coffee with Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take this experience up to
levels that nobody could even understand with their tiny shiny human brains all
you need for that is a cuper a mug or a glass a tanker cherine a canteen jug or
flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite liquid i like coffee and
join me now for the unparallel pleasure of the dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called
a simultaneous sip and it happens now
go ah
delightful all right so I wonder if there's any science that they could have
saved some money on if they had just asked me scott what do you think well oh
here's some yeah from Cypost Eric Nolan uh turns out that ugly
bystanders can make the other people look better um how many of you didn't know
that did you know that if you hang around with people who are uglier than you you look
better well that's why people hang around with me to look better
i'm your invisible friend sometimes but sometimes I'm your ugly friend so you if
anybody asks hey hey do you have any friends yeah that cartoonist guy and
then people will think you're awfully good-looking compared to
him so yes that's how you play that in other positive news
so MIT figured out uh how to make this little membrane that can separate uh
fuel by molecular size now that doesn't seem like a big
deal does it hey they get a membrane that can separate fuel by molecular size
well it turns out if you can do that you don't need to do the
expensive process of refining and refining
is energy intensive and it's a big deal and it's a lot easier to just put things
through a membrane and then it'll sort out the gas from the oil and all that
stuff so that's pretty impressive imagine it would uh cut the oil refining
energy cost by 90% if it worked speaking of other cool
technologies American style um the according to um an article in
interesting engineering the world's first mass producible nuclear
reactor is uh all set for testing as a it's a US startup so a startup called
Radiant is making a little 1 megawatt micro reactor that's based on a helium
gas cooled design with passive safety architecture and no reliance on water
for cooling so it's more for harsh environments and remote places
but does it surprise you that after decades of nuclear power plants that
seem to require water for cooling that suddenly there are all
these designs that don't require water for cooling and therefore ow and therefore
they're completely safe there there's a really big deal happening in nuclear power so if these
uh little micro reactors work and if they are safe because that's one of the
things if you don't if you don't have the water cooling you can make them just shut down without any
meltdown and that's what this little guy can do meanwhile over at Walt
Disney where the technology is 30 years behind
u there's going to be a new Walt Disney animatronic um character so the actual Walt Disney
himself he's uh going to be made into an updated animatronic i guess the
granddaughter doesn't like it but it's set to debut in July
now the question I ask you is what's the difference between a robot and an
animatronic Walt Disney and the answer is animatronic is
what you do when you can't make a robot and I guess the granddaughter
thought it was creepy yeah yeah she might she might so I don't think anybody
uh I can't imagine anyone booking a trip to Walt Disney because they got a
animatronic Walt Disney so maybe they need to do a little more
than that well JP Morgan is now going to accept
Bitcoin as collateral for loans and that might not seem like a big deal
to you but consider that the CEO JB Diamond uh once said that crypto was a
fraud and a Ponzi scheme and now they're accepting it as a
collateral for your loan so things are changing
i saw a uh exchange between Elon Musk who said um I think several years ago he
posted that uh Bitcoin was a safe word i think what he meant was you know if if
regular money became worthless you know you'd always have Bitcoin and I saw
uh Jack founder of Twitter um saying
Bitcoin because it's sort of time for that safe word maybe it is because uh
well we'll talk about that so in the sort of funniest PR story
uh you remember the exh White House secretary Kriden John
Pierre who was the worst press secretary any president ever had um she has now
written a book it's it's a memoir and it's called
Broken and the New York Post is writing about it and the funny part is that she
was the spokesperson for the Democrats during the Biden
administration and at the end of it decided she didn't even want to be a Democrat anymore
can you imagine her experience if she spent all that time being the face of Democrats or at least
in terms of press and then when she was done with it she was like you know what
I didn't want to be one of these people so I suspect she got a lot of uh
a lot of push back i saw separately a saw a post that suggested that uh she
was uh difficult to work with so maybe the other Democrats had some issues with
her we don't know um but I will compliment her for
coming up with that idea of uh changing parties because it's a real attention
getter if if the only thing she did was introduce yet another book about those
times then I would say well you know that's not too impressive but if she
announces she's changing parties well how do you ignore that so to me it
sounds like maybe it was her idea but maybe it was the book publicist
can't really tell if it was the book published this idea it was a really good
idea because you can't ignore it well in other
news very unsurprising uh Trump said he uh would
be ready to extend the Tik Tok ban uh as you know Tik Tok is scheduled
to be banned if we can't find a US buyer and
China's somewhat unwilling to sell so that never came together but uh Trump
says he's poised to expand it and apparently that'll get wrapped in with
some of his other trade talks with China so I think uh China wants to keep it as
uh one more thing they can hold over the heads of the US because you know u one
of Trump's biggest donors I believe is one of the biggest owners of Tik Tok so an American
guy so I don't see any uh scenario in which Trump is going to ban Tik Tok
because he said it worked for him now if you want to know how safe Tik Tok
is you wouldn't have to go back too far to find uh Fox News was doing stories
about Tik Tok was you know reprogramming our youth and it was terrible and then
suddenly there would be a bunch of Tik Tok commercials on Fox News did anybody
notice that and then after I don't know a year or two of Tik Tok commercials on
Fox News uh I think it was yesterday I saw they announced that Fox News would
have its own uh Tik Tok presence that's that's uh everything you
need to know no it's not going to be banned because apparently Trump doesn't
think it's dangerous to Trump because they got him elected um so maybe he
doesn't think it's dangerous in general i don't know i don't know but doesn't
look like it's going to get banned um however talking about banning uh
Trump is going to ban or has uh seven countries that'll be banned from entry
into the United States now remember he he did this once
before and he called it a Muslim band and everybody said racist racist you
can't do that and then he would point out well it's not every Muslim country
it's the ones that are you know a problem and that didn't make people happy but he said time to figure out how
to do his do his uh leadership a little bit more eleg
elegantly and now he just goes by country so he says Afghanistan Myanmar
Chad Republic of the Congo these are the ones with full
travel restrictions uh Equatorial Guinea
uh Aritria Haiti Iran Libya Somalia Sudan and
Yemen and then there are some with partial restrictions blah blah blah anyway
um part of my uh theme today is to try to help Democrats with attracting
men no not that way they they know how to attract men uh if they're gay men but
um take this topic for example do you think that the uh the idea of
restricting countries that have military agemen and potential terrorists and stuff do you
think that's an idea that appeals to men coming from the Republican party or
doesn't appeal to women i would argue that women would say "Hey uh give me my
diversity and don't you know don't uh paint all these people with the same
brush and let's have some empathy and maybe they need to escape their terrible
countries." And men would say "Um shut up ladies this is
military it's military it It's not really about immigration it's a pure and
military decision so if you were a young man and you wanted to be you know you're
looking at the two parties which of the two parties is a little closer to how
you feel well I would think that you would also feel that this is a military
decision now you wouldn't know the details you know like what is the specific risk from
you know equatorial Guinea but you would know for sure that if the government
banned them that there's some military risk and obviously this is this is going
beyond just immigration so it's not about immigration exactly it's about
military risk so once again an obvious case where men say "Oh well you
Republicans are doing what a man would want you to do protecting the country." And then we've got uh over in
Arizona Katie Hobbs so Katie Hobbs their governor
uh has vetoed a bill that would have prevented um the well Chinese owned
companies from having more than 30% of land in Arizona
uh meaning let me say that a different way that uh if a Chinese company owned
more than 30% of a particular piece of land that would be banned because
especially if they seem to be near military assets
now uh apparently that went through the legislation or legislature in Arizona
and then uh Governor Katie Hobbs vetos
it now what do you think men would do men would definitely ban
Chinese ownership of loss of land in their state because they would see that
as a military threat but Katie Hobbs did not so here again you see the Democrats
doing a thing that looks anti-male or at least opposite of what men would want or
do or or feel then there's a story about the Ukrainian
drones you know the story about the uh the gutsy attack by the Ukrainians and
they had Russian truck drivers drive truckloads worth of Ukrainian drones in
deep into Russia and then they release them and attack the airfield
well did you think that was a a bold military attack that was extra
successful or did you think that was a publicity thing which was primarily to
raise money for more military stuff well we're already getting the uh little
trickle that says you know there are some people saying that uh Ukraine really didn't destroy that
many airplanes in Russia so it was
successful but not nearly as successful as they claimed it sounds almost as if they're
trying to push some kind of publicity so why would they do that why
why would they try to act like they're more successful than they really were if
that's true well uh let's look at what happened
the UK has uh agreed to give 100,000 new
drones to uh Ukraine quote after the Russian air strike airfield strikes now
this is according to Newsweek now is that a do you think that's a total
coincidence that um that right after this there's this Ukrainian
claim that they had made great progress with drones that suddenly the UK could
approve 100,000 new drones for them i don't know if you look at the
whole picture it looks like it's kind of managed sort of a managed information
situation as in I don't think you can believe anything that comes out about
Ukraine um but the one thing you always look for is will this help them get more
weapons yes if if they can show that they were super successful using uh
drones against Russia then it will be way easier for them to get a whole bunch
of new drones from the UK and sure enough that's what's
happening well you probably heard that uh Elon Musk and President Trump are not
exactly on the same page on a few things specifically the big beautiful bill the
spending bill now uh if you're not familiar with the the budget process in
uh Washington you're lucky because it's a mess um this is just one kind of bill
it's not the whole budget it's a recession recession thing meaning it's
something they can cut uh it's complicated so it's not the entire
budget but it does suggest that they're not looking at the kinds of cuts that
Elon Musk and a lot of us would like to see so uh what has Elon said about the
big beautiful bill he's called it a disgusting
abomination and aborant an aborant package of deficit fueled uh
spending and he said call your senator call your congressman bankrupting
America is not okay kill the bill so that doesn't leave much doubt
where he's at imagine being Elon Musk and doing all that work and all that
personal sacrifice literally putting his life on the line he had to have you know lots
more security etc and then you don't get
the cost you were hoping for now um is it Stephen Miller or somebody else says
"Oh there's $1.6 trillion in cuts." Do you believe that
cuts or is it just that they could have spent more and they
didn't are they really cuts because I don't know that they are and are those cuts over one year or over
10 because 1.6 trillion doesn't sound like it's over one year but you notice
they always leave out the 10-year thing because two years from now the budget
will have nothing to do with anybody's intention you know two years
ago so you can make promises about how you'll cut the budget in the future but
you don't actually have to cut it because it's not the future so it does
look like there's a little trickery going on here um and I saw on CNN Scott Jennings was a
kind of challenged to essentially you know talk about the
difference between Musk and Trump on the big beautiful bill and I thought I
thought Jennings did a great job because instead of uh highlighting the
differences um he makes the point that the bill is you know right on point with what Trump
wants but then he also makes the point that you know the country and Musk and
most of us want big cuts and that the uh deficit is out of control so it was a
very careful very careful Scott Jennings answer because it it basically gave
attention to both sides but he didn't suggest a solution because what is a
solution i don't know if there is one so that was a good answer
um and then apparently there's an issue about uh Elon Musk had a preference for the
head of NASA um and it was somebody who had a SpaceX connection Jared
Isikman but he was rejected for reasons that are a little unclear to me
um and uh that makes Elon not too happy and then uh I guess he's also not too
happy because the big beautiful bill repeals tax credits for electric
vehicles which probably is a gigantic um a gigantic difference to
Tesla so on one hand it would be awkward if
Elon Musk got a bunch of things in that bill that were specific and good for him
you know he got his own NASA guy kept his cuts for electric vehicles which
doesn't really sound like a Republican thing so I feel like if you were Musk
how would you feel right now i think you'd feel you did a bunch of work for
Republicans and then they they kind of took from you the few things that would
have been good for your companies which is you know the head of NASA being his guy and uh electric
uh credits the tax credits for electric vehicles so I could see why he'd be a
little pissed do you think uh Elon Musk will be able to stop it from being
passed i think he might i think he might i don't know
we'll watch in other news I find
weird um Ed Martin is uh he's a pardon attorney
now did you know there was such a thing as a pardon attorney well I guess we got one the
postmillennial was talking about this um and I guess Ed Martin is going to look
into some of these sketches Biden pardons specifically his family
members as well as clemency to 37 inmates on death row
so but why are we even looking into that it's sort of a weird thing to look into
because isn't the very nature of a pardon the thing that everybody doesn't
like but you're not supposed to ask questions because it's a you know it's a complete right of the president i don't
know i don't love the fact that somebody's looking into pardons
i do think the pardons are sketchy but if a president has the you
know the total right to do something sketchy and then does I don't know do you investigate
that pardons are always sketchy but we'll find out maybe maybe
the autopen was involved that always makes it fun we like it when the auto pen is part
of the story well speaking of that uh big beautiful
bill uh Charlie Kirk had a really good post on X showing all the things in the
bill that Republicans would like and so I spent some time looking down the list
and I said to myself "Wow that's a lot of stuff I like." So on one hand um it's very Trumpian and
it's stuff he promised and uh you have to say that he's he's
delivering on those things that are on the list but Charlie Kirk um is uh sort
of involved in a half pinion meaning if you're not talking about the impact on
the budget and the deficit it doesn't really matter how many good things are
in there because we're all dead that's my take so that's that's
sort of similar to Elon Musk's yeah you could have 50 great Republican things in your bill
but if the entire country is bankrupt in a year none of those things
help so it doesn't help me to know that it's full of things I would
like um it only helps me if you can tell me I'll still be alive in a year
well maybe you uh Senator Mike Lee has proposed a
constitutional amendment for keeping uh keeping things under control fiscally he
said uh that it would automatically oust every member of Congress when inflation
exceeds 3% now what do you think of that
constitutional amendment that whenever inflation exceeds 3% every member of Congress gets
fired no well first of all I'm not sure
Congress has full control over inflation if they had 100% control over
inflation then I would say well maybe but there are external events that you
know influence inflation but on top of that what are the odds we would ever get
a constitutional amendment passed in 2025 or
2026 do you think we would ever get a constitutional amendment
passed i don't think so i I think it would just be partisan
and that's enough to kill it well you know for some time now I've
been telling you that AI might be
overrated and it might reach a plateau and it might not have a direct
path to so-called AGI or artificial general intelligence
i'm going to give you my my best uh idiots version of what AGI
is compared to what we have now um and this is stolen from Sundar
Pich um the CEO of Google he he was talking
about Whimo and he said uh Whimo is you know amazing technology that it can
drive around but he says you could teach a teenager how to drive in 20 hours and
that's all the car does now the difference between artificial general
intelligence and just a thing that you train to do a specific task like
Whimo is that we have the technology to make something do a specific set of
tasks that has a limited number of you know options but AGI would be a general
intelligence that could figure stuff out that we hadn't figured out
so for example uh you couldn't send an AI that was designed today uh into your
cabin in the woods and tell it look at the cabin figure out what work it needs
to do then order the parts and then do whatever handyman stuff needs to be done
robot now that would be general intelligence because because a human could do that
but uh apparently according to Sundar CEO of uh Google we don't really
have a direct path to that and that's the one everybody's worried about so
this is what I've been saying for some time and I was getting a little push back people were acting like "Oh no
they're they're just gonna make the data centers bigger and bigger until we reach
you know general intelligence." But I don't think we know what technology could get us to general
intelligence it's it's not doing more of what we're doing it would have to be
invented so I'll be uh curious if we can get
there all right so the funniest story I probably spent too much time on it is
the idea of the Democrats trying to attract men and I saw an article in The Hill
where it was talking about various experts and consultants and they each
had their own ideas about why the Democrats were not attracting men but I
think I've talked about a bunch of them which is Trump keeps doing confident
things that seem to have military utility that attracts men then you look
at the uh the recent uh signups for the military they're way
up because Trump treats the military with great respect and the way he talks
about it the way he funds it makes you think "Oh that's a respectable place to
be." Do Democrats do that no not nearly as much so every time you see anything
that would have a male female um energy to it the Republicans are
doing the right thing not because they're trying to attract men it's just it's the right thing you know closing
the borders to countries that we we can't vet the people come in that's
really not male or female that's just smart it's just that
men would have more appreciation for the the military aspect of that and then
they would say to themselves "Oh here's a country that's serious about protecting itself i should uh maybe look
into joining the military because that's a respectable kind of career so sure
enough recruitment is way up but here here are some of the things
the experts say about uh how the Democrats can get back those men they're
losing uh one of them is uh let's see here here's some expert who said "When
you're not talking about the working family you're never going to get those men back." Somebody named Roa
said now let me give you some advice if you'd ever like to be a political
consultant I'm going to give you 10 years of political consultant
advice in one sentence if you mention working families
everybody will think you're a genius that's it every time I see a
Democrat explaining why they haven't succeeded they say something like "Well
we're not talking enough about working families." To which I say "That's all it
takes to be a Democrat consultant or or the head of the uh entire party all it
takes is being able to say this the phrase working families." It's so empty all right
here's another one um so oh
uh we need authenticity and you can't manufacture it in a lab or war room said
Rodell Molina we need authenticity well how do you get
authenticity well one way would be to close the
borders to dangerous countries and just say that's my policy and to
um make sure that you're treating the military right there's no secret to it that the
things that attract men are pretty obvious to men
so you can't get authenticity by pretending to be
authentic trump actually did close the border to those countries trump actually does you know
confident male things there's no authenticity needed he He's just doing
what he does all right and then there's uh I love this one the the experts say
that Republicans became better at speaking to men through
podcasts god they're they're just so wrong about the podcast i don't think
that I don't think that Joe Rogan and uh Theo Vaughn were what caused men to be
become Republicans i think men were leaning Republican and then their two podcasters
who were compatible with how they were thinking the public
so I'm not so sure that Joe Rogan is moving the political needle as much as
the changes in politics that are happening because of Trump are creating
some people who maybe are finding Joe Rogan so maybe they have cause and
effect a little backwards there so but I don't think the podcasters are a big part of the story actually i mean
they're they're a big part of the media story because they're hugely successful
and influential but I don't think they really are what make
uh Republican men like Trump i don't think that's
happening not exactly
um and then there's another one who says another consultant they met male voters
exactly where they were and we on the other hand had nothing comparable so they really believe that
if they improved their podcasting game but didn't change their
policies that they would attract men does that sound real to you
like the the anti-gun people are just going to have a you know have a better
podcast it doesn't feel like it it doesn't feel like that's going to work i
love the fact that they think it would um and then there's uh one consultant um
strategist Eddie Vale who said one pretty simple and obvious answer if you
want blue collar men and women to support you go hang out with them and their
unions is that what Trump did did Trump go hang out with the bluecollar men in
their unions no no that's not going to
work you could hang out with them all you want i don't I don't think that's going to make a difference they're going
to care about you know the defense of the country and the closed borders they're going to care about tariffs but
they're not going to care if you you're not going to learn anything by hanging out with
them um and then uh and then Vale quipped that Democrats
were still in the hey let's have another conference phase of the rebuilding
effort so they genuinely do believe the Democrats do there's a messaging problem
as long as they think that they only have a messaging problem and not a candidate problem or a policy problem
they don't have any path there's no path to fixing it meanwhile uh
Schumer uh was talking about the big beautiful bill but he calls it cleverly
now look at look how clever this is he calls the big beautiful bill well we're all going to die
act death by a thousand paper
cuts so Chuck Schumer and here's what we're going to
do we're going to call it the well we're all going to die act oh
my god he was so lame the the best they could come up
with was changing the name of the act and then telling people that for a
variety of technical reasons that he calls a thousand paper cuts it will deny
people of benefits who should have them they are lost democrats are
absolutely lost and then uh what about Hakee Jeff
so Democratic leader Hakee Jeff he's calling to unmask ICE
agents literally to name them so it becomes more dangerous to deport the
dangerous people now is that a male or a female
uh thing to do well I would say a male
would want to keep the bad people out of the country so they would support ICE
and they would support ICE staying safe while they do it but now one of the two leaders of the
party wants to unmask literally unmask the ICE agents and tell everybody who
they are oh my god that is so not male uh Breitbart
News has that story so do do you see the pattern the pattern is it's what they
do it's not how they talk about it it's not their podcasters it's their policies
and and then you look at their their main guy if you look at Trump you see
this you know confident straight lace you know guy who can who will take
somebody on a world leader take him on in the White House uh we'll do any
argument we'll take any question and put you down and then you compare it to Chuck Schumer it's like yeah Chuck
Schumer I'm a penguin how are those even
similar one of them appeals to men in general and the other one just looks
like some kind of a penguin with glasses and you don't you don't even know what to think about it
anyway that ladies and gentlemen is all I had to talk about
today i think it's just enough time i got plenty of things to do today so I
got to go run and do them and thanks everybody for uh letting me take
yesterday off yesterday was kind of eventful but uh I'm back if it looks
like my neck is turned it's because I slept on it wrong and hurts like crazy
but uh other than that everything's fine and uh I'm going to say hi to the locals
people privately but the rest of you thanks for joining we'll see you same time
next 24 hours I guess
