everybody happy Memorial Day do you say happy Memorial Day or do
you just say Memorial Day always confuses me what's the most respectful thing to
say just it's Memorial Day
[Music] looks like we got more people on locals than anything else
today is there some problem with YouTube we only have four people coming in from
YouTube that's weird maybe something's going on over
there hey YouTube's just froze now for people huh weird all right
once again I'm your I'm your holiday
entertainment not a lazy podcaster like those other
people good morning everybody and welcome to the highlight of human civilization it's called Coffee with
Scott Adams and you've never had a better time but if you'd like to take this experience up to levels that nobody
can understand with their tiny shiny human brains all you need for that is a
cuper mug or a glass of tankered gels beside a canteen jug or flask a vessel of any kind fill it with your favorite
liquid i like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure of the
dopamine of the day the thing that makes everything better it's called a simultaneous sip and it's going to
happen right now
go that was just enough just what I needed uh my co-host today will be
President Trump fox and Friends in the morning they're very honorable
people from this day forward it's going to be only America first all right well
that's enough of that well did you know that uh that the
Tesla Optimus robot is going to use the same battery as the car i don't believe
it's going to be the same size though but apparently your your your Optimus uh
robot will be able to work all day long i was I was kind of wondering how much
you could get out of your robot before it had to charge itself but uh apparently all day long
and uh Musk has you know one of the toughest summers ever because not only
is Austin getting ready for full self-driving so Musk has to focus on
that um I saw somebody say that X might
be gaining uh the ability to send money and the ability to
chat um which I guess would be different than DMing I guess and so he's working
on that and Starship launch and AI and he's working on the uh working on the
DMs working because the DMs were not working again today he's got the busiest
summer man we're not going to hear much from him did you know according to the new
atlas that the the Air Force is planning a rocket that can bring
uh some enormous amount 100 tons of cargo to anywhere on Earth in 90 minutes
100 tons now I assume that's just for either
military or emergency response you wouldn't really want to spend that much money to bring a 100 tons of cargo
anywhere but uh how could that compete with Starship i'm I'm kind of I'm kind of
puzzled because I don't think the US Air Force knows how to make that
reusable and maybe it's not maybe it just stays there uh there's something wrong with that
story i I don't believe you could just the the Air Force could land a giant
rocket anywhere they want in 90 minutes and then it could take off and go back
home i don't think so but that's the story
well you've heard versions of this uh before but apparently the University of
Pennsylvania has found yet another material that can collect water and then
release it without any energy so you'd be able to just I don't
know hang it up on a clothesline and have it make water out of the air
so the whole problem of running out of water might not be a problem makes me
wonder if you could put like a little bit of it on a plant and then you'd never have to water
the plant wouldn't that be cool if you never had to water it they just took the
water out of the air and just dropped it on the plant that'd be kind of cool
well according to PJ Media the New York Times has a big story about the
Democratic Party being at a death spiral if your political
party is ever referred to as being at a death spiral that's bad but uh I guess the
evidence includes the fact that uh let's see in the 2024
election six times as many counties shifted toward the GOP as toward the
Democrats while uh I guess it was just a gigantic shift so so they say that Trump
has built an unstoppable coalition of workingclass people and the only people
left who are representative of the Democrats would be
uh basically wineing college
moms that's just me according to the uh Epoch Times
um Doge says it completed the major cleanup of social security
records so you know all those records of uh there were like 12 mill 12 million
people on the data who were over the age of
120 so they got rid of about 12 million records um 12.3 million records that were
apparently people who now have been marked as deceased so they didn't used to be
marked as deceased which means probably fraud probably 12 million people
fraudulently collecting social security but uh they put an end to
that well you know how Trump had threatened the European Union with a 50%
tariff well they called him Sunday night and said "Please don't do that." And I guess
it was a good phone call and Trump agreed to push it in a month you know once again that whole
threatening of a tariff it seems to work every time cuz the main thing he wanted is for
them to just get serious about negotiating and if they weren't serious or they
weren't weren't doing it fast enough he's just all 50%
tariff tariff for you tariff for you and then they call him and they say "No."
And then he says "All right if you're just going to try much harder to get this done." So that uh that tariff
threat it's working so I saw a long post on X
yesterday by Steven Miller now as you know Steven Miller is a important part
of the administration one of the smarter people there and he wanted to explain that
people had it wrong about the big beautiful bill the budget bill and he
said and he went into great detail saying how it would lower taxes and lower the deficit too
and I couldn't understand a damn sentence in there almost none of it made
sense to me now it doesn't mean he's wrong uh cuz he seemed to have a good
grasp of the topic and a much greater detail than I've seen before so he might
be right but I can't tell i can't tell by his writing it was
just just amazingly impenetrable uh but might have been right i don't
know but meanwhile Ron Johnson Republican who is very much on
the side of the president and the side of Steven Miller he says the
opposite he says that the uh budget's going to um exacerbate the national
deficit so could it be true that Steven Miller
is right that it will decrease the deficit while Ron Johnson is right that
it will increase it we can't tell it's really
complicated uh and the other thing that you need to
know and I wonder how many of you knew this there's a essentially the budget is
cut in two parts there's a small part which is this the
the so-called big beautiful bill is actually the smallest part of the budget and you only need 51 votes to
pass it so that works for the Republicans because they have a slight majority so
they can get this budget reconciliation process as they call it through with a
narrow vote if it comes to that but the biggest part of the budget they would
need 61 votes to presumably beat a uh what do you call it the uh
uh what's it called when the other side just talks forever what's that
called i always forget the name of that i I I've been stuck on this one before
it's called a You'll tell me in the comments in a second filibuster yes a
filibuster so the biggest part of the budget is not even part of the big beautiful budget this is just the the
little uh stuff that we can change and the big stuff probably won't be able to
change it at all because we won't be able to overcome the filibuster i'm
thinking um and then there's a question about are we cutting Medicaid or not
cutting Medicaid so Speaker Johnson has settled on this weird
messaging where we're totally cutting Medicaid but we're not cutting
Medicaid so he he's he's literally saying both things at the same time and
selling it so he says quote "We are not cutting Medicaid in this package."
Johnson said Sunday on the State of the Union there's a lot of misinformation
out there about this all right so that's pretty clear right you can't be more
clear than that we are not cutting Medicaid in this package and then later he says
uh that the goal of the is to protect Medicaid for vulnerable Americans i'm
like oh okay that's consistent with not cutting it
um by removing those who should not be receiving the benefits such as ille illegal immigrants and able-bodied
adults who are not working so he is not cutting
Medicaid and the way that he's going to do that is by cutting all these people
who are getting Medicaid and taking them off he's totally cutting Medicaid
he's just cutting it for a certain two classes of people illegal immigrants
most of you would agree agree with that um but able-bodied adults mostly men so
apparently uh and then the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that nearly 200,000
people in Louisiana alone that's Mike Johnson's own state could lose Medicaid
coverage uh because of the cuts there
so 200,000 people just in Louisiana alone will lose their coverage and then
Mike Johnson says "Oh we're totally not going to cut Medicaid." No I'm not disagreeing with anything they're doing
i'm just talking about the messaging that they're getting away with saying they're not cutting it at the same time
they're massively cutting it but they're massively cutting it from
uh able-bodied men who should get jobs and not be receiving it
and uh Johnston says the focus is on fraud waste and abuse and specifically
these young able-bodied workers who are taking advantage of the system we don't
want that no taking advantage of the system uh now also I only learned this
today apparently they uh Mike Johnson says they they tucked into this big
beautiful bill he told Face the Nation this a provision for uh that would
restrict federal courts ability to enforce some injunctions so you know how every time
Trump orders something there's always some federal judge who says "Not so fast
here's an injunction i will prevent you from doing it." And then has to go to the Supreme Court and Trump usually
wins so apparently they stuck that into the bill and uh it it's meant to restrict
activist judges we'll see um as long as the Senate doesn't try
to take it out I guess so here's a here's a thing that
I'm going to agree with Trump on quite a bit so I think we're something like 31%
of Harvard's students were foreign students now on one hand
um you might say to yourself there there are plenty of good reasons why a foreign student should be allowed to go to
Harvard but Harvard was not allowing white men and
Asian-Americans to get into Harvard and the slots were being filled
up by people from other countries now the problem is that if you get a
degree from Harvard and you know maybe this is changing quickly but if you have
a degree from Harvard isn't that like an amazing thing for the rest of
your life why were we giving 30% of them to people from foreign
countries when when there were people who were absolutely qualified you know
the Asian-Americans who were being turned down for Harvard totally qualified probably lots of white guys
too and they just couldn't get in because of their ethnicity but they're letting the
foreign the foreign workers 30% of their of their tra of their uh
students amazing amazing so I'm with Trump send them all
home we shouldn't ever been in this situation so I'm glad he's fixing
that and uh you wouldn't be surprised that uh Justin News is reporting that a
a judge has halted has halted
uh a judge has halted Trump's order to get rid of
the foreign students and that's why Speaker Johnson is trying
to stick into the big beautiful bill something to prevent these judges from
doing exactly this exactly this so I don't think this will stand i would
imagine that Supreme Court would say um you can't do that or possibly the big
beautiful bill will pass and then it would be legal for Trump to say we're
going to ignore you US District Court judge so we'll see how that goes
um Newsmax is reporting that one of the big problems with student
loans is that there are so many people who are behind on their student loans it's causing their credit scores
to plunge and the credit scores are plunging so much that if you wanted to
do something like rent an apartment you couldn't do it
now you're probably not able to buy a house you know even if you had the cash
well I mean you wouldn't have the cash because you're you're you're close to being a student so if you can't buy a
house and you can't rent one what's going to happen to you are
you going to have to hope that your parents take you in
somebody's calling it a grift that I that I had cancer so some of the worst people in
the world woke up early to watch my show how many of you think that my cancer is
a grift and I just made it up there are some terrible people in the
world terrible people anyway um so I know
somebody who once uh got on the list of
squatters now it was a special case situation with her boyfriend and they
were breaking up and he tried to get her out of the house but she squatted she and she squatted very successfully for a
very long time but once you squatted you can never rent a place
again cuz literally nobody in the world is going to rent a place to you if you've
ever even been squatted once so we've got this big problem of
people who made genuine mistakes you know that was a genuine
mistake but there's no way to recover i I feel like there's something that
needs to be adjusted or fixed or you know there needs to be a special place
you can go or something but there's going to be a ton of young people who
could never find a place on their own and they're never going to have kids they're never going to get married just
because their credit score is low and in some cases the story is that they didn't
know that they'd missed a payment you know they didn't get the mail and stuff like that but your life could be just
absolutely savaged by your your uh student
loan well according to that original sin book that's that Jake Tapper book and Alex Thompson when we're learning more
every day so apparently the people who were really running the country when
Biden was in office was a group that called themselves the poll
bureau now polit bureau is sort of a reference to communism where there's a group of
people in charge but here are the names of the people that according to the book were
actually in charge so if you want to know who is running the country well
we've got some pretty pretty extensive reporting on that and I've said this
before but the scariest part about this is that we we've never heard of most of these people at least half of them so
these are the people who are running the country when Biden was in office mike
Donalan Steve Rashetti Bruce Reed Jill
Biden Hunter Biden and uh sometimes Ron
Clay sometimes Annie Thomasino and sometimes Anthony Bernell so that was
the polar bo so it was exactly what you thought it
was you know how you thought to yourself I feel like there's some group of people
who have just taken charge of my government and I don't even know their names or who they are that's what was
happening that's exactly what was happening there was a small group of people you never heard of half of them
and they were running the country now um the the book also says that you
know uh Biden himself was usually involved in decisions but I
feel like this group might have been a little bit more
involved the the the troll with the all capital letters let's get rid of that
troll with the all capital letters well Alan Dersuit had a suggestion
uh that makes me feel good because it was the same thing I would have said so
whenever I agree with Ellen Dersuitz I think oh look at me look at me i didn't
even have to be a lawyer and I got that one right and he points out that uh if
you want to use that alien enemies act to get rid of you know the worst of
the uh the immigrants the illegal ones the uh the gang members etc and that
that's been kind of blocked because they need due process
um he says this you just have to give him due process but it's up to you to
decide what the due process is because it's not defined now due process for a
citizen is pretty well defined it's in the constitution but the courts just say
there has to be due process for the non-citizens so all you have to do is
make up a process and you just say this is our official process and now I'm
giving it to you and that process could be as simple as you have 72 hours to mount a
defense uh and that's it that's it you just make sure that they all have 72
hours and maybe the ability to place phone calls or whatever and then you can
ship them back and I thought to myself before Ellen Dersuit said it I
thought why don't we just make up a process and just make the process
friendlier to the country than it is to the people that we want to deport and
Duruititz just says that's all you got to do just make up a process because
that's the due process if you say it is because it's is not
defined so we're on the same page there
dur according to the postmillennial um about 25% of corporate sponsors have
scaled back whatever they were going to do for the pride parade so I guess that's coming up in
June and according to the New York Times um people are pulling back they're
afraid of overdoing it and getting in trouble so
25% scaled back and I always thought to myself then I then I saw some uh
reference to the fact that the the the gay pride parade people you know were they had less
money and I thought to myself how much money do you need for a gay pride
parade couldn't you just wear your street clothes and walk down the street
do do you have to dress in a you know wildly
provocative way like why does that give you more
pride couldn't you just walk down the street whistling and and everybody would
say "All right good job the gay gay community has
done an amazing job and in uh becoming part of normal you know the the rest of
civilization exactly like they wanted to and uh take the win i always say this
the LGBT not so much the T but the uh
lesbians and gays have done such a good job in in uh improving their brand in
the United States and and I always say stuff like have you ever gone to a a
neighborhood and said to yourself "Oh it's a dangerous neighborhood it's it's a gay neighborhood."
Nope it's one of the most successful subgroups in the entire United States
take the win you have your parade but does it really have to spend a lot
of money i don't know i I think just uh enjoy the win
uh according to Bloomberg the profits from solar power
companies have plunged and the reason is it's too sunny now I don't know how this
makes sense but part of the story is that the immense amount of captured
sunlight uh but they couldn't store it because they don't have enough batteries so they
captured amazing amounts of sun just like they wanted to and then they had to let it all
go so they had very little uh battery storage i'm thinking to
myself is this another thing that Elon Musk needs to fix i I think Elon Musk can fix this
he's got batteries so Europe France and Spain is mostly France
and Spain so they uh yeah they didn't they didn't build their solar plant too
wisely how many of you saw the video of uh President Mcronone of France being
pushed in the face by his wife so Mcronone and his wife are in
Vietnam it's part of a international um trip they're making and I don't know
what's going on but you see Mcronone standing in still inside the airplane but he's getting ready to uh go down the
stairs so you know the cameras are rolling and everything and suddenly you see his wife's hand uh push him in the
face like like her her hand goes over his mouth and just sort of pushes his
head and then he realizes that it's on camera and everybody's watching and he's
got to play it off like oh that didn't happen i think at first he tried to say it was
AI deep fake nobody bought that of course and then it turned into "Oh it's
just my wife being playful but allegedly when they were walking down the steps a
moment later he uh held down his arm to so that she could hold his arm when they
went down the stairs and she did not hold his arm." So it kind of looks like
uh Mrs mcronone is not too happy with her husband
so let me give you some advice if you're ever married to the
president of a country don't assault him on camera in front of the
world it's just not a good look and none of it was important it looked like you
know maybe they were just having some argument about something you know it wasn't going to hurt him it was just
sort of a dismissive pushway but uh we uh but but you have to see the
video yourself you can you can decide for yourself well there's a story that uh several
days ago uh Putin was in a helicopter looking at some of the front
line and the war and he was visiting Kursk and uh
allegedly there was a organized drone attack against his helicopter trying to
assassinate him basically and it was Ukrainian drones and then
allegedly the Russian defenses defeated all the drones and none of them hit the
helicopter now I saw a story that said maybe this isn't
true but um it would make sense in this in the uh if you looked at what's what
Russia is doing right now which is they're doing massive attacks on Kiev so
it could be that because of the attempted assassination Putin's just going really
hard and uh Trump's kind of mad at him trump said "Uh I've always had a very
good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia but something has happened to him
he has gone absolute crazy." He's talking about the severity with which
Putin is attacking Ukraine at the same time that Trump's trying to get him to
talk peace but that would make sense if if Putin had survived an
assassination attempt so then then you could kind of understand you might be going a little
nuts so uh Israel has announced they waited
for a a holiday to announce this um holiday in the United States that uh
according to the Wall Street Journal that the Israeli military on Sunday Sunday plans to capture 75% of the Gaza
Strip within two months and push Palestinian civilians into just a
quarter of the strip's territory as part of their effort to get rid of
Hamas now here's the here's the weird part the
uh the part that they want to push the civilians into so presumably that allows
them to really get u get tough on Hamas and their tunnels and finish them off uh
America is apparently the aid source so to feed the Gazins who are
being pushed into a quarter of the territory um apparently that's your taxes and mine
to which I say what well why is America paying to feed
the Gazins i mean I'd rather that they don't starve of course but are you
saying that Israel can't afford to do it like is there some reason that
Israel's war requires the United States to feed their the people on the other
side of the war what's up with that so that part
doesn't make sense yeah I don't know why we're doing that but you might remember that I've uh long
suggested what I called the filter fence where you you move the people into
a safe zone that can be determined that they're not combatants and then you go
wild on the whatever's left and it looks like they've they're doing the filter fence
um strategy now when I talk about Israel if you're new to me I'm not endorsing
anything they do so I'm not pro or anti- anything to do i just
observe and report so uh my my view is that whoever
has power over there they're going to be accused of genocide by the other side
now is that good or bad it's not up to me so it's not up to me to decide what
is moral or ethical or good or bad i
believe that uh the children are going to be the victims no matter who had the power and who was doing what to whom
there will be children dying and nobody likes that so you could be against
children dying but if you don't have some kind of larger solution with all
your brilliance to make it stop and I don't I don't have any way to make it
stop um you can just observe so I observe that they're doing
uh what makes sense for Israel and that's as far as I'll go
but uh you can't really be in favor of it you can just watch it and say
"Well makes sense for them." All right um you know the story
of South Africa and whether or not there's a white genocide going over on
over there and uh some of the evidence of the white genocide appear to be fake
but there's plenty that doesn't appear to be fake and Laura Logan
um I was seeing the Vigilant Fox report on this she uh she says "Oh there's
definitely a white genocide in South Africa." I didn't realize that she came from South Africa so she has a little
more connection to it than the rest of us um but here's here's my question
i do believe that there would be plenty of examples of white farmers
uh you know being tortured and having stuff stolen from them but if it's also
true that everybody is being you that that the crime in general is just so bad
that the black citizens are getting just as much crime in other words everybody's a
victim of crime if you live there doesn't matter if you're white or black it kind of it does kind of blur that
whole white genocide area like it if all
you have to do to get to be a victim of crime in South Africa is show up and you
don't it doesn't matter what color you are if you've got money somebody's going to want to take it from
you i don't know what to call that i mean I guess it's white
genocide i guess it is but wouldn't there be a black genocide happening at the same time or it doesn't
account if the people who are doing it the crime are also black so you have a
different word for it or something well I would say generally speaking stay away
from massive crime if you can here's a story in the Daily Mail i
think it was in India but the story was a little unclear on
that but I think it was India they they convicted somebody
um for poisoning her fiance by putting u sensors on her head and essentially
doing some version of a uh you know a lie detector but uh a more high-tech one
so they placed a cap with electroas on her head and they played specific
phrases about the crime and then they said "We can tell by looking at our
readout that you're guilty." Now apparently it works 90% of
the time but that would not be nearly enough
i do think however we're reaching a point where the lie detector or the
ability to read your brain basically is going to be so good that your entire
trial might be just putting on a cap and turning it on and asking you some questions now we're not there 90% is not
nearly good enough you know you need something like 100% i think we might get to 100%
i I think the technology for telling if you're lying could get to
100% i think it might meanwhile there's some kind of
super bug according to Neoscope that uh it's a nasty
bacteria that eats hospital plastic so you know a lot of uh medical
stuff and hospital stuff is made of plastic well this uh this
bacteria that starts with people and then I guess it can get into the environment will also eat the
plastic and it digests medical plastic it makes me wonder if there's Yeah it's
also deadly so you don't want it in your body but it what makes me wonder if they can modify that thing so it eats the
plastic that's in my body the microlastics that's apparently in my
balls i don't know maybe I I feel like the whole too much plastic and
microlastics there's going to be some kind of technological fix where they take one of these nasty bacteria and do
a little crisper stuff on it and tweak it a little bit so it's not dangerous for people but it still likes to eat
plastic and then you you take a pill every morning with some of those
bacteria in there it's like it just eats all the plastic in your body and then it dies because it doesn't have any more
food all right that's all I got today because
it's Memorial Day and there's not much happening but uh glad I could spend this
time with you i'm going to say some uh private stuff to the people on
locals [Music] um it'll mutate and eat
people oh well use the nanobots in the co shout to
destroy the microlastics all
right all right ladies and gentlemen thanks for joining um we'll uh show our
respect on Memorial Day and uh I'm going to talk to the local subscribers privately the rest of
you I will see you on Monday thanks for
joining all right we got about 30
